In 1931, Osaka Castle Park was opened to the public, but most of the area was used by the Imperial Japanese Army. After World War II, most of the military complex was removed and replaced by the public urban park.\nIn the park, there is Osaka Castle Hall, a large athletic field, baseball field, football field, open-air music theatre, open-air concert hall, and Osaka Castle Keep Tower.

The museum is located between the D\u014djima River and the Tosabori River, above Osaka's subterranean National Museum of Art. Opened in 1989, the museum was constructed to mark the 100th anniversary of Osaka City. The construction was funded through a 6.5 billion yen donation toward building costs from Kansai Electric. Its theme is \"The Universe and Energy\". Before the war a similar museum opened in 1937. It was known as the Osaka City Electricity Science Museum and it was both the first science museum and the first planetarium in Japan.\nThe Science Museum's primary permanent exhibition consists of four floors of mainly interactive science exhibits, totaling 200 items, with each floor focusing on a different theme. There is also a live science show with science demonstrations several times per day. Like the rest of the museum, these demonstrations are in Japanese only and visitors may require prior scientific knowledge to enjoy them.\nThe two secondary exhibits, both available separately from the primary exhibit, are a planetarium, which has a dome with a radius of 26.5 meters, the 7th largest in the world which projects the images of the heavens. In July 2004, the planetarium reopened after a renovation displaying the entire night sky as a next-generation digital image.\nThe museum also houses a collection of scientific resources, including \n* Japan's first planetarium (a Carl Zeiss II model)\n* the Cockcroft-Walton accelerator \n* resources related to Seimikyoku, Japan's first full-fledged chemistry laboratory\n* pre-war electrical measuring devices\nIts collection of books and magazines for a general audience, largely on astronomy, is the most comprehensive in West Japan.\nThe science building is the place where Hideki Yukawa created his theory on mesons, for which he was awarded a Nobel prize.

The founding collection is known as the Attic Collection, and is an early 20th-century ethnological collection of mainly Japanese materials, including some early finds of J\u014dmon archaeological artifacts (in the Morse Collection). Further collections were brought together for the opening in 1977 and collecting activities have continued since. \nThe main focus of collection has been film, still images, sound recordings, and objects representing diverse aspects of everyday life, from farming to food, urban life, folk crafts, and religion. Permanent galleries for all large regions of the world display only part of the full collection.\nTwo special exhibitions of approximately three months duration are presented in Spring and Autumn each year, and there are numerous smaller temporary exhibitions on special themes. \nThe museum has a staff of approximately 70 researchers, and actively supports visits by scholars around Japan and abroad. The museum library is one of the largest academic, multiple-language reference libraries in Japan, with books and journal in Japanese, English, Chinese, Spanish, and other languages. The library is linked to a national network of public university libraries.\nThe Museum offers PhD courses in association with Japan's Inter-University of Advanced Graduate Studies (S\u014dkendai), an inter-institutional organization that provides administration for students placed in public research institutes and laboratories all over Japan.\nThe National Museum of Ethnology is also a founding member of the National Institutes for Humanities (NIHU), Japan.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+81 6-6876-2151", "ordinal": 1}, {"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": "113 (\u81ea\u7136\u6587\u5316\u5712\u30fb\u65e5\u672c\u5ead\u5712\u4e2d\u592e)", "ordinal": 2}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["museums", "sightseeing", "subtype-Archaeological_museums"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Archaeological museums", "short_name": "archaeology", "label": "subtype-Archaeological_museums", "location_id": "Osaka", "score": 3.28283214917868, "poi_count": 1, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.21960687834098}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "wv__Kansai", "score": 9.88626631198346, "poi_count": 21995, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "With its political and geographical significance in the history of Japan, the region of Kansai possesses three quarters of Japan's \"National Treasure\" buildings, half of its \"National Treasure\" artworks, as well as five UNESCO World Heritage Sites, making it an unmatched destination for heritage tourists to Japan."}, "object_score": 8.21960687834098}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "Osaka", "score": 9.49557203346311, "poi_count": 5310, "tour_count": 5, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "Osaka's best known sight is the Osaka castle.

A small port is located nearby, and much of the mountain's surface has been converted into a park.", "properties": [{"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": " (\u6d77\u904a\u9928); 88", "ordinal": 1}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["district", "sightseeing", "poitype-Park", "relaxinapark", "district-bay_area"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Park", "short_name": "park", "label": "poitype-Park", "location_id": "Japan", "score": 9.5638930905807, "poi_count": 43009, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.20390639126144}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Park", "short_name": "park", "label": "poitype-Park", "location_id": "Osaka", "score": 8.82984131039059, "poi_count": 1679, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.20390639126144}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Relax in a park", "short_name": "Relax in a park", "label": "relaxinapark", "location_id": "Japan", "score": 9.56390050553144, "poi_count": 43217, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.20390639126144}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Park", "short_name": "park", "label": "poitype-Park", "location_id": "wv__Kansai", "score": 9.38523248512388, "poi_count": 6192, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.20390639126144}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Relax in a park", "short_name": "Relax in a park", "label": "relaxinapark", "location_id": "Osaka", "score": 8.83005459551975, "poi_count": 1689, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.20390639126144}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "Osaka", "score": 9.49557203346311, "poi_count": 5310, "tour_count": 5, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "Osaka's best known sight is the Osaka castle.

Expoland was cited by authorities for faulty maintenance when similar axle cracks were found on a second train a month later.\nThe park reopened after the accident but closed again on December 9, 2007, citing a lack of customers.

The capacity of the arena is 8,000 people. Its total revenue for the 2006 fiscal year was 260 million yen, of which sumo provided 80 million.\nIn April 2008 the Japan Sumo Association made clear its surprise at plans by the prefectural government to demolish the gymnasium and sell the vacant lot.\nIn March 2012, the arena was renamed Bodymaker Colosseum after the naming rights were sold to sports apparel company BB Sports for the next three years. The name was changed back in April 2015, when BB Sports did not renew their deal. In June 2015, the Edion Corporation signed a three-year deal for the arena's naming rights, renaming it Edion Arena Osaka.\nIt has hosted several professional wrestling shows, including Osaka Hurricane from 2005 to 2012, NJPW Dominion from 2009 to 2014, NJPW Power Struggle since 2011, and The New Beginning in Osaka since 2012.\nThe venue hosted the Rizin 19 mixed martial arts fight on October 12, 2019.", "properties": [{"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "http://www.furitutaiikukaikan.jp/", "ordinal": 1}, {"key": "subway", "name": "Subway", "value": "M (Namba)", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "train", "name": "Train", "value": "Namba", "ordinal": 3}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["do", "sports", "district", "poitype-Sport_venue", "district-chc5abc58d-ku"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Activities", "short_name": "Activities", "label": "do", "location_id": "Japan", "score": 9.80608020637197, "poi_count": 32721, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "It shouldn't be surprising that in a country where more than 70% of the terrain is forests and mountains, outdoor activities abound."}, "object_score": 7.01423599100231}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Ch\u016b\u014d-ku", "short_name": "Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Osaka", "label": "district-chc5abc58d-ku", "location_id": "Osaka", "score": 9.69053909268762, "poi_count": 3142, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "Ch\u016b\u014d-ku is one of 24 wards of Osaka, Japan.

The neighbourhood was created in 1912 with New York as a model for its southern half and Paris for its northern half. At this location, a Luna Park amusement park operated from 1912 until it closed in 1923.\nAs a result of minimal redevelopment after World War II, the area has become one of Japan's poorest. Despite its negative image and commonly held reputation as Osaka's most dangerous area, Shinsekai boasts a colourful history and unique identity. At the beginning of the 20th century the neighbourhood flourished as a local tourist attraction showcasing the city's modern image. The centrepiece of the neighbourhood was Tsutenkaku Tower (the \"tower reaching to heaven\").\nWhether the stigma surrounding Shinsekai is deserved is open to debate. Many Osakans claim to be afraid to set foot in the area. The travel guide Lonely Planet Japan, warns visitors to \"keep their wits about them\" as Shinsekai may be the \"closest thing in Japan to a dangerous neighbourhood\". Although in the 15th edition of this travel guide, published in 2017, this is not mentioned anymore. However, Shinsekai's status as a dangerous area owes much to criminal activity that flourished in the decades before the 1990s. Continuing the area's chequered fortunes of recent years, in place of rampant criminality, Osaka's large permanent settlement of homeless has taken root in the areas around Shinsekai. Homeless men, often elderly, from all over Japan come to Osaka to escape the stigma of hometown societal shame and wander the streets around the area. The neighbourhood is also home to a large presence of prostitutes and a concentration of Osaka's cross-dressing community.\nThough its elements of seediness and destitution are often highlighted, Shinsekai is also home to a large number of legitimate business outlets. It is the scene of low-cost restaurants, cheap clothing stores, cinemas, shogi and mahjong clubs, and pachinko parlours.\nShinsekai has several fugu (blowfish) restaurants, but the neighbourhood's real culinary forte is kushi-katsu. The neighbourhood abounds with kushi-katsu restaurants offering various kinds of meat, fish, and vegetables all breaded and deep fried on small sticks for around 150 yen each.\nShinsekai sits next to Tennoji Zoo, Tennoji Park, and the Osaka Municipal Museum of Art, to the east. To the south is Spa World and the now-closed Festival Gate, a compact amusement park built to rejuvenate Osaka's most run-down area. Instead of trying to blend the park into Shinsekai, its construction resulted in virtually barricading it from the surrounding neighbourhood. It remained open for nearly seven years but in February 2004 a joint-venture behind the operation went into bankruptcy, effectively shutting down the complex for the most part. As an amusement space, it was no match for nearby Universal Studios Japan, which opened in 2002. In early 2008, the city began calling for tenders from prospective buyers although, by this point, a crepe shop adjoining Spa World was the only business still operating in the empty complex.\nThe top of Tsutenkaku Tower provides a panoramic and unobstructed view of Osaka.", "properties": [{"key": "tram", "name": "Tram", "value": " (Ebisucho); HN", "ordinal": 1}, {"key": "subway", "name": "Subway", "value": "K (Ebisucho)", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "train", "name": "Train", "value": "Ebisucho", "ordinal": 3}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["dancing", "character", "nightlife", "character-Adult_content", "poitype-Entertainment_district"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Adult content", "short_name": "adult content", "label": "character-Adult_content", "location_id": "Japan", "score": 6.02785931673218, "poi_count": 20, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 6.9334378257817}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Dancing", "short_name": "Dancing", "label": "dancing", "location_id": "wv__Kansai", "score": 6.47683759792975, "poi_count": 46, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 6.9334378257817}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Character", "short_name": "Character", "label": "character", "location_id": "Japan", "score": 9.88681532438098, "poi_count": 26674, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 6.9334378257817}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Dancing", "short_name": "Dancing", "label": "dancing", "location_id": "Japan", "score": 9.28899649149997, "poi_count": 339, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 6.9334378257817}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Character", "short_name": "Character", "label": "character", "location_id": "Osaka", "score": 8.29756338517111, "poi_count": 1760, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 6.9334378257817}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Character", "short_name": "Character", "label": "character", "location_id": "wv__Kansai", "score": 9.87565022565881, "poi_count": 4971, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 6.9334378257817}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Nightlife", "short_name": "Nightlife", "label": "nightlife", "location_id": "Osaka", "score": 7.97727047821478, "poi_count": 2620, "tour_count": 1, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "There are many nightlife districts in Osaka.
