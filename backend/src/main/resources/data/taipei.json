The park is used by residents of Taipei as a green activity space and for various outdoor activities.

The museum was founded on March 28, 1997 by Mr Lin Wen-ren and his wife. It is located in Zhongshan District, Taipei, Taiwan.\nMr. Lin and his wife enjoyed buying little houses and toy cars for their children while traveling for business purposes. While in Netherlands, they discovered miniature art and were deeply attracted. They began buying accessories, furniture, and assembled miniature houses. At the same time, the couple participated in auctions and joined international miniature art associations. They began planning their museum in 1993.\nThe logo of the museum comes from \"Rose Mansion\", one of the museum's most famed collections.\nChosen as one of ten most significant miniature art works of America in twenty-five years, \"Rose Mansion\" consumed Dr. Reginald Twigg almost four years to complete. After his elaborate research and study the once famous architecture has been brought back to life as you now see in the museum.\nThe logo represents delicate, real, dream-like, romantic, and historically correct nature of miniature arts.\nMiniatures originated within German palaces of the 16th century as tools for teaching aristocratic children, but appreciation for the art form did not pass to other parts of the world until much later during the 19th century. Today, miniature masterpieces are found throughout Europe and North America covering subjects from complete settings to intricate accessories of tableware and wall paintings. Reproductions tend to follow a 1:12 standard scale of accuracy, or half scale at 1:24.\nTaiwan's museum is the first to specialize in contemporary miniatures and features two formats: \"doll house\" and room box with cut away views. It is ranked second in the world, with a collection of nearly 200 items.

It includes two skyscrapers, the taller is 337m with 76 floors and the shorter is 280m with 56 floors. It's near Taipei Station, Shin Kong Life Tower and Taipei Bus Station. When the complex is complete, it will be the 2nd tallest building in Taipei and 3rd tallest in Taiwan after Taipei 101 and Kaohsiung's 85 Sky Tower. It is estimated to cost NT$12 billion (US$414 million). The two buildings (C1 and D1) were initially expected to open in 2016 and 2017, respectively;however, the project was delayed in 2015 due to a series of complication in the bidding process, which has restarted in 2018.\nThe skyscrapers have been designed by MVRDV in collaboration with CHY Architecture Urban Landscape to revitalise the central station area in the capital's Zhongzheng District and will be constructed as a pile of blocks, each fronted by screens that will display \"major cultural spectacles, sporting events, and advertising\", establishing the area as \"a Times Square for Taiwan\". Designed to be built over the existing station, Taipei Twin Towers' block structure increases in size with each storey, so that the lower levels are a more \"human-scale\" to complement the surrounding buildings. These lower level blocks will be organised around public atriums and used for retail. Each block will contain a shop. Above, the larger blocks will be occupied by offices, cinemas, and two hotels. The east tower is designed for \"young travellers\", while the west tower focuses more on \"the luxury market\". Plant-filled terraces will top the tower's retail storeys, providing meeting and rest places for visitors. They will be accessed by elevated walkways and escalators that connect the lower 20 floors of the building and their surroundings.\nDesigned to encourage \"exploration\", MVRDV has divided these walkways into named routes, including entertainment, sport and food, which also provide alternative access to the stores. MVRDV also plans to incorporate an elevated walkway that connects to the existing station, for which there are currently two designs. The Taipei Twin Towers will also see the redevelopment of the existing plazas surrounding the station. MVRDV will introduce a series of structures that reference the history of the site, positioned on former locations of the original station and plaza, and neighbouring houses. These structures will be topped by pergolas, transforming them into shaded platforms for events and other public activities. \nThe basement of building C1 is the terminus for the Taoyuan Airport MRT.", "properties": [{"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "Sec 1, Zhongxiao West Road", "ordinal": 1}, {"key": "directions", "name": "Directions", "value": "Across from the main post office.", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": "232, 247, 262, 262\u5340, 276 (Taipei Post Office); 12, 206, 302, 304\u627f\u5fb7, 660, 756, 9, \u7da017, \u85cd29 (MRT Beimen Station); 223, 252, 601, 637, 640 (\u81fa\u5317\u90f5\u5c40(\u64ab\u81fa\u8857\u6d0b\u6a13)); 257, 513, 605 (Taipei Main Station (Chongqing)); 202, 202\u5340, 205, 212, 212\u76f4, 243, 253, 265\u5340, 307, 604, 667, 671 (Zhonghua Rd.

However, some of the animal enclosures are small and seem over-crowded. Due to the city government's education policy, the zoo is very much an integral part of Taipei life. So much so in fact, that when an old elephant became ill and died several years ago, several generations turned up, many with tears in their eyes, to say their farewells. The zoo is recently popular in Taiwan for its two pandas, a gift from China. The zoo is located in the suburb of Muzha, and the entrance is just outside the terminal stop on the Muzha MRT line, 'Taipei Zoo'.

Since then and throughout the rest of the 19th century, Dihua Street has been an important centre for commerce in Taiwanese products and produce such as Chinese medicinal herbs, fabrics, incense materials, and for the post-processing of Taiwanese tea.\nBeing the oldest street in Taipei (with sections in existence since the rule of Dutch Formosa from 1624\u20131661), its architecture has been under preservation and conservation efforts by the city. Modern Dihua Street along with its surrounding neighborhood and streets, known as the Dihua Street commercial loop (\u8fea\u5316\u8857\u5546\u5708), remain one of the most commercially active in Taipei with transactions in excess of 3 billion US dollars.\nThe name \"Dihua\" was given in 1947 by the Republic of China government, in reference to the city of Dihua (now called \u00dcr\u00fcmqi) in Xinjiang, and effectively joins a string of existing older streets in this area of Taipei.

Originally an illegal settlement, it was founded by the Kuomintang military veterans at the end of the 1940s and served originally as an anti-aircraft position. \nAfter cooperating with non-governmental organization Global Artivists Participation Project, the Taipei City Government developed the area into an example of environmentally sustainable urban community. With the policy of preservation and revitalization, the old settlement unfolded a new vision of an artivist compound which would respect the existing fabric of the community while fulfilling the regeneration concept of \"symbiosis\" to incorporate production and ecology in communal living and ushering in the program of an international youth hostel and creative ideas of art to further cultural exchanges with broader international communities. \nCommissioned by the municipal government to propose an ecological masterplan for the area, Finnish architect Marco Casagrande found that this settlement, perhaps because of its illegal and marginal status, has evolved organically to operate according to an ecological model: recycling and filtering grey water, using minimal amounts of electricity (\u201cstolen\u201d from the city grid), composting organic waste, and repurposing Taipei\u2019s waste. Casagrande relates his experiences of working on the site: For the ecological urban laboratory I had to do nothing, it was already there. What I did was to construct wooden stairways and connections between the destroyed houses and some shelters for the old residents to play mah-jong and ping-pong. \nThe community has been featured in The New York Times as one of Taiwan's must-see destinations. \nTreasure Hill is the attic of Taipei carrying the memories, stories and traditions of the past generations. In some way it is a reflection of the Taipei mind that the industrial city is not able to reflect. For the stories to surface the industrial city must be turned over: the city must be a compost. \u2014Marco Casagrande \nPolice closed the area in 2007 in order to guarantee safety for restoration work. The restored Treasure Hill reopened as an artist village in 2010 with only 22 original families managing to move back to the settlement. The restoration process has been criticized to have caused the neighbourhood to be stripped of its prior residents and turned into a space which celebrates individual expression and artistic creativity at the expense of housing lower income families.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+886 2 2364 5313", "ordinal": 1}, {"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "No. 2, Alley 14, Ln. 230 Dingzhou Rd.

Located on the northern border of the district, Tianmu borders the neighboring district of Beitou and Yangmingshan National Park.\nTianmu is best known as an enclave for Taiwan's US expatriate community. From the mid 1950s to 1979, before the US broke formal ties with Taiwan, large portions of the US Armed Forces serving under MAAG and their families stationed in Taiwan lived in Tianmu. Middle- to lower-ranking US servicemen resided within present-day Tianmu, while higher-ranking officers resided in neighboring Yangmingshan. Other than military housing and recreation, significant portions of modern-day Tianmu were designated for housing developments created for USAID workers and foreign civilians. As of the 1980s relatively few of these Western style developments and buildings remain as they have been replaced by multi-storey apartment blocks. The road layout in Tianmu still aligns to the former Western style neighborhoods.\nWith the withdrawal of the US military in 1979, the Bank of Taiwan re-purposed the former sites by leasing them to Taipei American School and Taipei Japanese School. With the further creation of Taipei European School, Tianmu has continued to attract foreign residents. In addition, several of the countries which retain diplomatic relationships with Taiwan have their foreign embassies and consulates located in Tianmu.\nTianmu is home to Taiwan's first branch of Mister Donut, a Shin Kong Mitsukoshi department store, a Sogo department store, and a Dayeh Takashimaya department store. There is also one Movie Theater, Wovie Cinema Tianmu. In addition, It also hosts a number of Western and Japanese restaurants, as well as specialty stores which cater to the expat community.\nTianmu Baseball Stadium, which replaces the old Taipei Municipal Baseball Stadium, is located in Tianmu.
