It is Europe's busiest shopping street, with around half a million daily visitors, and as of 2012 had approximately 300 shops. It is designated as part of the A40, a major road between London and Fishguard, though it is not signed as such, and traffic is regularly restricted to buses and taxis.\nThe road was originally part of the Via Trinobantina, a Roman road between Essex and Hampshire via London. It was known as Tyburn Road through the Middle Ages when it was notorious for public hangings of prisoners at Tyburn Gallows. It became known as Oxford Road and then Oxford Street in the 18th century, and began to change from residential to commercial and retail use by the late 19th century, attracting street traders, confidence tricksters and prostitution. The first department stores in the UK opened in the early 20th century, including Selfridges, John Lewis & Partners and HMV. Unlike nearby shopping streets such as Bond Street, it has retained an element of downmarket trading alongside more prestigious retail stores. The street suffered heavy bombing during World War II, and several longstanding stores including John Lewis were completely destroyed and rebuilt from scratch.\nDespite competition from other shopping centres such as Westfield Stratford City and the Brent Cross Shopping Centre, Oxford Street remains in high demand as a retail location, with several chains having their flagship stores on the street, and has a number of listed buildings. The annual switching on of Christmas lights by a celebrity has been a popular event since 1959. As a popular retail area and main thoroughfare for London buses and taxis, Oxford Street has suffered from traffic congestion, pedestrian congestion, a poor safety record and pollution. Various traffic management schemes have been implemented by Transport for London (TfL), including a ban on private vehicles during daytime hours on weekdays and Saturdays, and improved pedestrian crossings.", "properties": [{"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": ", N137 (John Prince's Street / Oxford Circus); 12, 22, 453, 88, N109, N136, N15, N18, N22, N3 (Oxford Circus Station / Margaret Street); 139, 159, 94, N113 (Oxford Circus Station); 113 (Margaret Street / Oxford Circus); 7, 98, N7, N98 (Oxford Circus Station / Harewood Place); 390, 55, 73, N207, N25, N55, N73, N8 (Great Titchfield Street / Oxford Circus Station)", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "subway", "name": "Subway", "value": "Bakerloo, Central, Victoria (Oxford Circus)", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "train", "name": "Train", "value": "Oxford Circus", "ordinal": 4}, {"key": "shops_include", "name": "Shops include", "value": "Urban Outfitters, Topshop, Russell & Bromley, Schuh, Niketown, Bershka, Topman, Miss Selfridge, Ecco, Ernest Jones, Aldo, Pandora, Foot Locker, Three, Moss Bros, King of London, Carphone Warehouse, Surprise Surprise, Gift Land, H Samuel, Reserved, Sole Trader, Geox.", "ordinal": 5}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["do", "district", "shopping", "character", "character-Adult_content", "poitype-Shopping_district", "district-west_end_of_london"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Adult content", "short_name": "adult content", "label": "character-Adult_content", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.19729235086232, "poi_count": 109, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.99391103218991}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Shopping district", "short_name": "shopping district", "label": "poitype-Shopping_district", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.40138494466779, "poi_count": 108, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.99391103218991}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Districts", "short_name": "Districts", "label": "district", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.98367334494397, "poi_count": 46744, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.99391103218991}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "West End of London", "short_name": "West End of London", "label": "district-west_end_of_london", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.92452934458838, "poi_count": 1976, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "The West End of London (commonly referred to as the West End) is a district of Central London, west of the City of London and north of the River Thames, in which many of the city's major tourist attractions, shops, businesses, government buildings and entertainment venues, including West End theatres, are concentrated."}, "object_score": 9.99391103218991}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Character", "short_name": "Character", "label": "character", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.9769441114992, "poi_count": 27082, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.99391103218991}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Shopping", "short_name": "Shopping", "label": "shopping", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.96832343951844, "poi_count": 37252, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "The currency throughout the UK is the pound (\u00a3) (ISO code.

Informally known as the Houses of Parliament after its occupants, the Palace lies on the north bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster, in central London, England.\nIts name, which derives from the neighbouring Westminster Abbey, may refer to either of two structures: the Old Palace, a medieval building-complex destroyed by fire in 1834, or its replacement, the New Palace that stands today. The palace is owned by the monarch in right of the Crown and, for ceremonial purposes, retains its original status as a royal residence. Committees appointed by both houses manage the building and report to the Speaker of the House of Commons and to the Lord Speaker.\nThe first royal palace constructed on the site dated from the 11th\u00a0century, and Westminster became the primary residence of the Kings of England until fire destroyed much of the complex in 1512. After that, it served as the home of the Parliament of England, which had met there since the 13th\u00a0century, and also as the seat of the Royal Courts of Justice, based in and around Westminster Hall. In 1834 an even greater fire ravaged the heavily rebuilt Houses of Parliament, and the only significant medieval structures to survive were Westminster Hall, the Cloisters of St Stephen's, the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft, and the Jewel Tower.\nIn the subsequent competition for the reconstruction of the Palace, the architect Charles Barry won with a design for new buildings in the Gothic Revival style, specifically inspired by the English Perpendicular Gothic style of the 14th\u201316th centuries. The remains of the Old Palace (except the detached Jewel Tower) were incorporated into its much larger replacement, which contains over 1,100 rooms organised symmetrically around two series of courtyards and which has a floor area of 112,476m2. Part of the New Palace's area of 3.24ha was reclaimed from the River Thames, which is the setting of its nearly 300m fa\u00e7ade, called the River Front. Augustus Pugin, a leading authority on Gothic architecture and style, assisted Barry and designed the interior of the Palace. Construction started in 1840 and lasted for 30 years, suffering great delays and cost overruns, as well as the death of both leading architects; works for the interior decoration continued intermittently well into the 20th\u00a0century. Major conservation work has taken place since then to reverse the effects of London's air pollution, and extensive repairs followed the Second World War, including the reconstruction of the Commons Chamber following its bombing in 1941.\nThe Palace is one of the centres of political life in the United Kingdom; \"Westminster\" has become a metonym for the UK Parliament and the British Government, and the Westminster system of government commemorates the name of the palace. The Elizabeth Tower, in particular, often referred to by the name of its main bell, Big Ben, has become an iconic landmark of London and of the United Kingdom in general, one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city, and an emblem of parliamentary democracy. Tsar Nicholas I of Russia called the new palace \"a dream in stone\".\nThe Palace of Westminster has been a Grade I listed building since 1970 and part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.",

culture. Its permanent collection of some eight million works is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence, having been widely sourced during the era of the British Empire. It documents the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present. It was the first public national museum in the world.\nThe British Museum was established in 1753, largely based on the collections of the Irish physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane. It first opened to the public in 1759, in Montagu House, on the site of the current building. Its expansion over the following 250 years was largely a result of expanding British colonisation and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions, the first being the Natural History Museum in 1881.\nIn 1973, the British Library Act 1972 detached the library department from the British Museum, but it continued to host the now separated British Library in the same Reading Room and building as the museum until 1997.

It was founded in 1852 and named after Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.\nThe V&A is located in the Brompton district of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, in an area that has become known as \"Albertopolis\" because of its association with Prince Albert, the Albert Memorial and the major cultural institutions with which he was associated. These include the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, the Royal Albert Hall and Imperial College London. The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. As with other national British museums, entrance is free.\nThe V&A covers 12.5acre and 145 galleries. Its collection spans 5,000 years of art, from ancient times to the present day, from the cultures of Europe, North America, Asia and North Africa. However, the art of antiquity in most areas is not collected. The holdings of ceramics, glass, textiles, costumes, silver, ironwork, jewellery, furniture, medieval objects, sculpture, prints and printmaking, drawings and photographs are among the largest and most comprehensive in the world. \nThe museum owns the world's largest collection of post-classical sculpture, with the holdings of Italian Renaissance items being the largest outside Italy. The departments of Asia include art from South Asia, China, Japan, Korea and the Islamic world. The East Asian collections are among the best in Europe, with particular strengths in ceramics and metalwork, while the Islamic collection is amongst the largest in the Western world. Overall, it is one of the largest museums in the world.\nSince 2001, the museum has embarked on a major \u00a3150m renovation programme. New 17th- and 18th-century European galleries were opened on 9 December 2015. These restored the original Aston Webb interiors and host the European collections 1600\u20131815. The V&A Museum of Childhood in East London is a branch of the museum, and a new branch in London is being planned.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 7942 2000",

London is a natural history museum that exhibits a vast range of specimens from various segments of natural history. It is one of three major museums on Exhibition Road in South Kensington, the others being the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. The Natural History Museum's main frontage, however, is on Cromwell Road.\nThe museum is home to life and earth science specimens comprising some 80 million items within five main collections: botany, entomology, mineralogy, paleontology and zoology. The museum is a centre of research specialising in taxonomy, identification and conservation. Given the age of the institution, many of the collections have great historical as well as scientific value, such as specimens collected by Charles Darwin. The museum is particularly famous for its exhibition of dinosaur skeletons and ornate architecture\u2014sometimes dubbed a cathedral of nature\u2014both exemplified by the large Diplodocus cast that dominated the vaulted central hall before it was replaced in 2017 with the skeleton of a blue whale hanging from the ceiling. The Natural History Museum Library contains extensive books, journals, manuscripts, and artwork collections linked to the work and research of the scientific departments; access to the library is by appointment only. The museum is recognised as the pre-eminent centre of natural history and research of related fields in the world.\nAlthough commonly referred to as the Natural History Museum, it was officially known as British Museum (Natural History) until 1992, despite legal separation from the British Museum itself in 1963. Originating from collections within the British Museum, the landmark Alfred Waterhouse building was built and opened by 1881 and later incorporated the Geological Museum. The Darwin Centre is a more recent addition, partly designed as a modern facility for storing the valuable collections.\nLike other publicly funded national museums in the United Kingdom, the Natural History Museum does not charge an admission fee. (It did but was scrapped in 2001) \nThe museum is an exempt charity and a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, is a patron of the museum. There are approximately 850 staff at the museum. The two largest strategic groups are the Public Engagement Group and Science Group.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 7942 5000", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "email", "name": "Email", "value": "info@nhm.ac.uk", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "Cromwell Rd", "ordinal": 4}, {"key": "directions", "name": "Directions", "value": "tube: South Kensington.

at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in London and is usually extended to refer to both the clock and the clock tower. The official name of the tower in which Big Ben is located was originally the Clock Tower, but it was renamed Elizabeth Tower in 2012 to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.\nThe tower was designed by Augustus Pugin in a neo-Gothic style. When completed in 1859, its clock was the largest and most accurate four-faced striking and chiming clock in the world. The tower stands 315ft tall, and the climb from ground level to the belfry is 334 steps. Its base is square, measuring 39ft on each side. Dials of the clock are 23ft in diameter. On 31 May 2009, celebrations were held to mark the tower's 150th anniversary.\nBig Ben is the largest of the tower's five bells and weighs 13.5LT. It was the largest bell in the United Kingdom for 23 years. The origin of the bell's nickname is open to question; it may be named after Sir Benjamin Hall, who oversaw its installation, or heavyweight boxing champion Benjamin Caunt. Four quarter bells chime at 15, 30 and 45 minutes past the hour and just before Big Ben tolls on the hour. The clock uses its original Victorian mechanism, but an electric motor can be used as a backup.\nThe tower is a British cultural icon recognised all over the world. It is one of the most prominent symbols of the United Kingdom and parliamentary democracy, and it is often used in the establishing shot of films set in London. The clock tower has been part of a Grade I listed building since 1970 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.\nOn 21 August 2017, a four-year schedule of renovation works began on the tower, which are to include the addition of a lift. There are also plans to re-glaze and repaint the clock dials. With a few exceptions, such as New Year's Eve and Remembrance Sunday, the bells are to be silent until the work is completed in 2021.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 7219 4272", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "Bridge Street", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "http://www.bigbenfacts.co.uk", "ordinal": 4}, {"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": "148, 211 (Westminster Station / Westminster Pier);

Westminster, London, to the south of Mayfair, between Hyde Park Corner in the west and Piccadilly Circus in the east. It is part of the A4 road that connects central London to Hammersmith, Earl's Court, Heathrow Airport and the M4 motorway westward. St James's is to the south of the eastern section, while the western section is built up only on the northern side. Piccadilly is just under 1mi in length, and it is one of the widest and straightest streets in central London.\nThe street has been a main thoroughfare since at least medieval times, and in the Middle Ages was known as \"the road to Reading\" or \"the way from Colnbrook\". Around 1611 or 1612, a Robert Baker acquired land in the area, and prospered by making and selling piccadills. Shortly after purchasing the land, he enclosed it and erected several dwellings, including his home, Pikadilly Hall. What is now Piccadilly was named Portugal Street in 1663 after Catherine of Braganza, wife of Charles II, and grew in importance after the road from Charing Cross to Hyde Park Corner was closed to allow the creation of Green Park in 1668. Some of the most notable stately homes in London were built on the northern side of the street during this period, including Clarendon House and Burlington House in 1664. Berkeley House, constructed around the same time as Clarendon House, was destroyed by a fire in 1733 and rebuilt as Devonshire House in 1737 by William Cavendish, 3rd Duke of Devonshire. It was later used as the main headquarters for the Whig party. Burlington House has since been home to several noted societies, including the Royal Academy of Arts, the Geological Society of London, the Linnean Society, and the Royal Astronomical Society. Several members of the Rothschild family had mansions at the western end of the street. St James's Church was consecrated in 1684 and the surrounding area became St James Parish.\nThe Old White Horse Cellar, at No.\u00a0155, was one of the most famous coaching inns in England by the late 18th century, by which time the street had become a favoured location for booksellers. The Bath Hotel emerged around 1790, and Walsingham House was built in 1887. Both the Bath and the Walsingham were purchased and demolished, and the prestigious Ritz Hotel built on their site in 1906. Piccadilly Circus station, at the east end of the street, was opened in 1906 and rebuilt to designs by Charles Holden between 1925 and 1928. The clothing store Simpson's was established at Nos.\u00a0203\u2013206 Piccadilly by Alec Simpson in 1936. During the 20th century, Piccadilly became known as a place to acquire heroin, and was notorious in the 1960s as the centre of London's illegal drug trade. Today, it is regarded as one of London's principal shopping streets. Its landmarks include the Ritz, Park Lane, Athenaeum and Intercontinental hotels, Fortnum & Mason, the Royal Academy, the RAF Club, Hatchards, the Embassy of Japan and the High Commission of Malta.\nPiccadilly has inspired several works of fiction, including Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest and the work of P. G. Wodehouse. It is one of a group of squares on the London Monopoly board.

residence and administrative headquarters of the monarchy of the United Kingdom. Located in the City of Westminster, the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning.\nOriginally known as Buckingham House, the building at the core of today's palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years. It was acquired by King George\u00a0III in 1761 as a private residence for Queen Charlotte and became known as The Queen's House. During the 19th\u00a0century it was enlarged, principally by architects John Nash and Edward Blore, who constructed three wings around a central courtyard. Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837.\nThe last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the East Front, which contains the well-known balcony on which the royal family traditionally congregates to greet crowds. A German bomb destroyed the palace chapel during World War II; the Queen's Gallery was built on the site and opened to the public in 1962 to exhibit works of art from the Royal Collection.\nThe original early 19th-century interior designs, many of which survive, include widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis, on the advice of Sir\u00a0Charles Long. King Edward\u00a0VII oversaw a partial redecoration in a Belle \u00c9poque cream and gold colour scheme. Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese regency style with furniture and fittings brought from the Royal Pavilion at Brighton and from Carlton House. The palace has 775 rooms, and the garden is the largest private garden in London. The state rooms, used for official and state entertaining, are open to the public each year for most of August and September and on some days in winter and spring.", "properties": [{"key": "phone",

Square in the City of Westminster, in Central London. Founded in 1824, it houses a collection of over 2,300 paintings dating from the mid-13th century to 1900.\nThe Gallery is an exempt charity, and a non-departmental public body of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Its collection belongs to the government on behalf of the British public, and entry to the main collection is free of charge. In 2019, it was ranked seventh in the world on the List of most visited art museums. \nUnlike comparable museums in continental Europe, the National Gallery was not formed by nationalising an existing royal or princely art collection. It came into being when the British government bought 38 paintings from the heirs of John Julius Angerstein in 1824. After that initial purchase the Gallery was shaped mainly by its early directors, notably Sir Charles Lock Eastlake, and by private donations, which today account for two-thirds of the collection. The collection is small compared with many European national galleries, but encyclopaedic in scope; most major developments in Western painting \"from Giotto to C\u00e9zanne\" are represented with important works. It used to be claimed that this was one of the few national galleries that had all its works on permanent exhibition, but this is no longer the case.\nThe present building, the third to house the National Gallery, was designed by William Wilkins from 1832 to 1838. Only the facade onto Trafalgar Square remains essentially unchanged from this time, as the building has been expanded piecemeal throughout its history. Wilkins's building was often criticised for the perceived weaknesses of its design and for its lack of space; the latter problem led to the establishment of the Tate Gallery for British art in 1897.\nThe Sainsbury Wing, a 1991 extension to the west by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, is a notable example of Postmodernist architecture in Britain. The current Director of the National Gallery is Gabriele Finaldi.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 7747 2885", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "email", "name": "Email",

It was a Chinese restaurant for a couple of years then reopened in 2003 as an upscale European-style restaurant after renovation by British restaurateurs Chris Corbin and Jeremy King.", "properties":

Building of the palace began in 1515 for Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, a favourite of King Henry VIII. In 1529, as Wolsey fell from favour, the cardinal gave the palace to the king to check his disgrace. The palace went on to become one of Henry's most favoured residences; soon after acquiring the property, he arranged for it to be enlarged so that it might more easily accommodate his sizeable retinue of courtiers. Along with St James' Palace, it is one of only two surviving palaces out of the many the king owned. The palace is currently in the possession of Queen Elizabeth II and the Crown. \nIn the following century, King William III's massive rebuilding and expansion work, which was intended to rival the Palace of Versailles, destroyed much of the Tudor palace. His work ceased in 1694, leaving the palace in two distinct contrasting architectural styles, domestic Tudor and Baroque. While the palace's styles are an accident of fate, a unity exists due to the use of pink bricks and a symmetrical, if vague, balancing of successive low wings. King George II was the last monarch to reside in the palace.\nToday, the palace is open to the public and a major tourist attraction, easily reached by train from Waterloo station in central London and served by Hampton Court railway station in East Molesey, in Transport for London's Zone 6. In addition, London Buses routes 111, 216, 411 and R68 stop outside the palace gates. The structure and grounds are cared for by an independent charity, Historic Royal Palaces, which receives no funding from the Government or the Crown. In addition, the palace displays many works of art from the Royal Collection.\nApart from the Palace itself and its gardens, other points of interest for visitors include the celebrated maze, the historic royal tennis court (see below), and the huge grape vine, the largest in the world . The palace's Home Park is the site of the annual Hampton Court Palace Festival and Hampton Court Palace Flower Show.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 844 482 7777",

It had the rigorous philosophy that the foods of the different regions could best be cooked by the chefs from that region. It was an extremely ambitious undertaking and akin to having a pan European gourmet. Chutney Mary was probably the first Indian restaurant in the world to trace the regional provenance of each dish. Chutney Mary was also pioneered as an Indian restaurant in taking wines seriously, and led the way in the pairing of Indian food and wine.\nThe regional provenance and the dishes on the Chutney Mary proved the trailblazer for the supermarket packaged foods \u2013 e.g. Waitrose which from the mid 1990s started prepared dishes with the regional provenance and with names from the Chutney Mary

London, built between 1886 and 1894. The bridge crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London and has become an iconic symbol of London. As a result, it is sometimes confused with London Bridge, about half a mile (0.8\u00a0km) upstream. Tower Bridge is one of five London bridges owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust overseen by the City of London Corporation. It is the only one of the trust's bridges not to connect the City of London directly to the Southwark bank, as its northern landfall is in Tower Hamlets.\nThe bridge consists of two bridge towers tied together at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal tension forces imposed by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers. The vertical components of the forces in the suspended sections and the vertical reactions of the two walkways are carried by the two robust towers.

Known principally for its traditional bespoke tailoring for men, the street has had a varied history that has included accommodating the headquarters of the Royal Geographical Society at 1 Savile Row, where significant British explorations to Africa and the South Pole were planned; and more recently, the Apple office of the Beatles at 3 Savile Row, where the band's final live performance was held on the roof of the building.\nOriginally named Savile Street, it was built between 1731 and 1735 as part of the development of the Burlington Estate. It was designed under the influence of Burlington's interpretation of Palladian architecture, known as \"Burlingtonian\". Henry Flitcroft, under the supervision of Daniel Garrett, appears to have been the main architect \u2013 though 1 and 22\u201323 Savile Row were designed by William Kent. Initially, the street was occupied mainly by military officers and their wives; later William Pitt the Younger and Irish-born playwright and MP Richard Brinsley Sheridan were residents.\nTailors started doing business in the area in the late 18th century; first in Cork Street, about 1790, then by 1803 in Savile Row itself. In 1846, Henry Poole, later credited as the creator of the dinner jacket or tuxedo, opened an entrance to Savile Row from his tailoring premises in Old Burlington Street. Founded in 1849 by Henry Huntsman, H. Huntsman & Sons moved to No. 11 Savile Row with the ending of the war in 1919. During the First World War, Huntsman's was a tailor to the military, producing dress uniforms for British officers throughout the conflict. In 1969, Nutters of Savile Row modernised the style and approach of traditional Savile Row tailoring; a modernisation that continued in the 1990s with the \"New Bespoke Movement\", involving the designers Richard James, Ozwald Boateng, and Timothy Everest. The term \"bespoke\" as applied to fine tailoring is understood to have originated in Savile Row, and came to mean a suit cut and made by hand.", "properties": [{"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "http://WestEndatWar.org.uk", "ordinal": 1}, {"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": "12, 139, N113, N15, N3 (Beak Street / Hamleys Toy Store); 22, N22 (Conduit Street / Savile Row); 159, 453, 88, 94, N109, N136, N18 (Conduit Street / Hamleys Toy Store);  (Conduit Street); 14, 19, 38, 6, 9, N19, N38, N9, N97 (Old Bond Street / Royal Academy)", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "shops_include", "name": "Shops include", "value": "Joseph, Cad & the Dandy, Lanvin Boutique, Gaziano & Girling, Hardy Amies.", "ordinal": 3}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["do", "district", "shopping", "district-mayfair", "poitype-Shopping_district"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Districts", "short_name": "Districts", "label": "district", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.98367334494397, "poi_count": 46744, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.7866203681885}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Activities", "short_name": "Activities", "label": "do", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.9688289246772, "poi_count": 51234, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "Although most visitors will visit London at some point, it is well worth getting out of the capital to get a real taste of the country and important to not forget the diversity one can find in barely 50 miles."}, "object_score": 9.7866203681885}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Shopping district", "short_name": "shopping district", "label": "poitype-Shopping_district", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.40138494466779, "poi_count": 108, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.7866203681885}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Mayfair", "short_name": "Mayfair", "label": "district-mayfair", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.83772075630123, "poi_count": 1339, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "Mayfair is an affluent area in the West End of London towards the eastern edge of Hyde Park, in the City of Westminster, between Oxford Street, Regent Street, Piccadilly and Park Lane."}, "object_score": 9.7866203681885}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Shopping", "short_name": "Shopping", "label": "shopping", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.96832343951844, "poi_count": 37252, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "The currency throughout the UK is the pound (\u00a3) (ISO code.

It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, which is separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite. The castle was used as a prison from 1100 (Ranulf Flambard) until 1952 (Kray twins), although that was not its primary purpose. A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat. There were several phases of expansion, mainly under kings Richard I, Henry III, and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries. The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site.\nThe Tower of London has played a prominent role in English history. It was besieged several times, and controlling it has been important to controlling the country. The Tower has served variously as an armoury, a treasury, a menagerie, the home of the Royal Mint, a public record office, and the home of the Crown Jewels of England. From the early 14th century until the reign of Charles II, a procession would be led from the Tower to Westminster Abbey on the coronation of a monarch. In the absence of the monarch, the Constable of the Tower is in charge of the castle. This was a powerful and trusted position in the medieval period. In the late 15th century, the castle was the prison of the Princes in the Tower. Under the Tudors, the Tower became used less as a royal residence, and despite attempts to refortify and repair the castle, its defences lagged behind developments to deal with artillery.\nThe peak period of the castle's use as a prison was the 16th and 17th centuries, when many figures who had fallen into disgrace, such as Elizabeth I before she became queen, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Elizabeth Throckmorton, were held within its walls. This use has led to the phrase \"sent to the Tower\". Despite its enduring reputation as a place of torture and death, popularised by 16th-century religious propagandists and 19th-century writers, only seven people were executed within the Tower before the World Wars of the 20th century. Executions were more commonly held on the notorious Tower Hill to the north of the castle, with 112 occurring there over a 400-year period. In the latter half of the 19th century, institutions such as the Royal Mint moved out of the castle to other locations, leaving many buildings empty. Anthony Salvin and John Taylor took the opportunity to restore the Tower to what was felt to be its medieval appearance, clearing out many of the vacant post-medieval structures. \nIn the First and Second World Wars, the Tower was again used as a prison and witnessed the executions of 12 men for espionage. After the Second World War, damage caused during the Blitz was repaired, and the castle reopened to the public. Today, the Tower of London is one of the country's most popular tourist attractions. Under the ceremonial charge of the Constable of the Tower, and operated by the Resident Governor of the Tower of London and Keeper of the Jewel House, the property is cared for by the charity Historic Royal Palaces and is protected as a World Heritage Site.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 3166 6000", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "Tower Hill", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "directions", "name": "Directions", "value": "tube:", "ordinal": 4}, {"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "http://www.hrp.org.uk/TowerOfLondon/", "ordinal": 5}, {"key": "price", "name": "Price", "value": "\u00a324.50, aged 5-16 \u00a311.00, concession \u00a318.70, family (2A+3C) \u00a360.70.

moved from Greenwich to Herstmonceux) is an observatory situated on a hill in Greenwich Park, overlooking the River Thames. It played a major role in the history of astronomy and navigation, and because the prime meridian passes through it, it gave its name to Greenwich Mean Time. The ROG has the IAU observatory code of 000, the first in the list. ROG, the National Maritime Museum, the Queen's House and Cutty Sark are collectively designated Royal Museums Greenwich.\nThe observatory was commissioned in 1675 by King Charles II, with the foundation stone being laid on 10 August. The site was chosen by Sir Christopher Wren. At that time the king also created the position of Astronomer Royal, to serve as the director of the observatory and to \"apply himself with the most exact care and diligence to the rectifying of the tables of the motions of the heavens, and the places of the fixed stars, so as to find out the so much desired longitude of places for the perfecting of the art of navigation.\" He appointed John Flamsteed as the first Astronomer Royal. The building was completed in the summer of 1676. The building was often called \"Flamsteed House\", in reference to its first occupant.\nThe scientific work of the observatory was relocated elsewhere in stages in the first half of the 20th century, and the Greenwich site is now maintained almost exclusively as a museum, although the AMAT telescope became operational for astronomical research in 2018.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 8312 6565", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "email", "name": "Email", "value": "bookings@rmg.co.uk", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "Flamsteed House", "ordinal": 4}, {"key": "directions", "name": "Directions", "value": "in the middle of Greenwich Park", "ordinal": 5}, {"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "http://www.rmg.co.uk", "ordinal": 6}, {"key": "price", "name": "Price", "value": "Free for entry to the observatory, \u00a315 entrance for the Meridian Line and Flamsteed House, planetarium shows separate \u00a38 (combined tickets available)", "ordinal": 7}, {"key": "hours", "name": "Hours", "value": "Daily 10AM-5PM, closed 24-26 Dec", "ordinal": 8}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["person", "museums", "sightseeing", "person_architect", "person_architect-christopher_wren"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Architect", "short_name": "Architect", "label": "person_architect", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.77583772623702, "poi_count": 465, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.75847481449411}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Christopher Wren", "short_name": "Wren", "label": "person_architect-christopher_wren", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 8.64057576997422, "poi_count": 45, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.75847481449411}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Person", "short_name": "Person", "label": "person", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.93119660820644, "poi_count": 1761, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.75847481449411}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.95977622430187, "poi_count": 9866, "tour_count": 298, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "London is a huge city, so all individual listings are in the appropriate district articles and only an overview is presented here."}, "object_score": 9.75847481449411}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Architect", "short_name": "Architect", "label": "person_architect", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.89226651252968, "poi_count": 1544, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.75847481449411}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Person", "short_name": "Person", "label": "person", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.83788122194504, "poi_count": 534, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.75847481449411}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Museums", "short_name": "Museums", "label": "museums", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.83799933827047, "poi_count": 613, "tour_count": 26, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.75847481449411}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Christopher Wren", "short_name": "Wren", "label": "person_architect-christopher_wren", "location_id": "London", "score": 8.44712118889607, "poi_count": 40, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "Sir Christopher Wren PRS FRS (/r\u025bn/;

After a weak beginning, the hotel began to gain popularity towards the end of World War I, and became popular with politicians, socialites, writers and actors of the day in particular. David Lloyd George held a number of secret meetings at the Ritz during the latter half of the war, and it was at the Ritz that he made the decision to intervene on behalf of Greece against Turkey. No\u00ebl Coward was a notable diner at the Ritz in the 1920s and 1930s.\nOwned by the Bracewell-Smith family for a period until 1976, The Ellerman Group of Companies purchased the hotel for \u00a380 million from Trafalgar House in October 1995. They spent eight years and \u00a340 million restoring it to its former grandeur. In 2002, it became the first hotel to receive a Royal warrant from the Prince of Wales for its banquet and catering services.\nThe exterior is both structurally and visually Franco-American in style with little trace of English architecture, and is heavily influenced by the architectural traditions of Paris. The facade on the Piccadilly side is roughly 231ft, 115ft on the Arlington Street side, and 87ft on the Green Park side. At the corners of the pavilion roofs of the Ritz are large green copper lions, the emblem of the hotel. The Ritz has 111 rooms and 25 suites.\nThe Ritz Club, owned by the owners of the Ritz Hotel since 1998, is a casino in the basement of the hotel, occupying the space which was formerly the Ritz Bar and Grill. It offers roulette, black jack, baccarat, and poker, as well as some slot machines.\nThe interior was designed mainly by London and Paris based designers in the Louis XVI style, which is consistent throughout. Author Marcus Binney describes the great suite of ground-floor rooms as \"one of the all-time masterpieces of hotel architecture\" and compares it to a royal palace with its \"grand vistas, lofty proportions and sparkling chandeliers\".\nThe Ritz's most widely known facility is the Palm Court, which hosts the famous \"Tea at the Ritz\". It is an opulently decorated cream-coloured Louis XVI setting, with panelled mirrors in gilt bronze frames. The hotel has six private dining rooms, the Marie Antoinette Suite, with its boiserie, and the rooms within the Grade II* listed William Kent House. The Rivoli Bar, built in the Art Deco style, was designed in 2001 by interior designer Tessa Kennedy, to resemble the bar on the Orient Express.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 7493 8181", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "150 Piccadilly, W1J 9BR", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "https://www.theritzlondon.com/", "ordinal": 4}, {"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": ", 14, 19, 22, 38, 6, 9, N19, N22, N38, N9, N97 (Green Park Station)", "ordinal": 5}, {"key": "subway", "name": "Subway", "value": "Jubilee, Piccadilly, Victoria (Green Park)", "ordinal": 6}, {"key": "train", "name": "Train", "value": "Green Park", "ordinal": 7}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["hotels", "district", "district-mayfair", "architectural_style", "architectural_style-edwardian_architecture"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Districts", "short_name": "Districts", "label": "district", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.98367334494397, "poi_count": 46744, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.73953668176878}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Edwardian architecture", "short_name": "Edwardian", "label": "architectural_style-edwardian_architecture", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.08646988069812, "poi_count": 68, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.73953668176878}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Hotels", "short_name": "Hotels", "label": "hotels", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.69641294634226, "poi_count": 24889, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "The UK offers a wide variety of hotels rated on a scale of stars, from 5-star luxury (and beyond!) to 1-star basic."}, "object_score": 9.73953668176878}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Edwardian architecture", "short_name": "Edwardian", "label": "architectural_style-edwardian_architecture", "location_id": "London", "score": 8.31383884983386, "poi_count": 29, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "Edwardian architecture is an architectural style popular during the reign of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom (1901 to 1910)."}, "object_score": 9.73953668176878}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Hotels", "short_name": "Hotels", "label": "hotels", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.65931860046432, "poi_count": 1675, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "London has hundreds of options for accommodation to suit all budgets from hostels through historic bed and breakfasts (B&Bs), mainstream chain hotels and apartments all the way to some of the most exclusive luxury hotels in the world such as The Savoy, The Ritz and Claridges where a stay in a top suite will cost upwards of \u00a31,000 per night."}, "object_score": 9.73953668176878}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Mayfair", "short_name": "Mayfair", "label": "district-mayfair", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.83772075630123, "poi_count": 1339, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "Mayfair is an affluent area in the West End of London towards the eastern edge of Hyde Park, in the City of Westminster, between Oxford Street, Regent Street, Piccadilly and Park Lane."}, "object_score": 9.73953668176878}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Architectural style", "short_name": "Architectural style", "label": "architectural_style", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.8633660823061, "poi_count": 598, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.73953668176878}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Architectural style", "short_name": "Architectural style", "label": "architectural_style", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.95499043007387, "poi_count": 3207, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.73953668176878}], "booking_info": null, "attribution": [{"source_id": "openstreetmap", "url": "http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/26706806"}, {"source_id": "wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Ritz%20Hotel%2C%20London"}, {"source_id": "wikivoyage", "url": "http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/London/Mayfair-Marylebone"}], "price_tier": null, "opening_hours": {"open_24_7": true, "days": {"sun": [{"start": null, "end": null}], "mon": [{"start": null, "end": null}], "tue": [{"start": null, "end": null}], "wed": [{"start": null, "end": null}], "thu": [{"start": null, "end": null}], "fri": [{"start": null, "end": null}], "sat": [{"start": null, "end": null}]}}, "snippet": "One of the London's great hotels for more than a century.

It is the largest of four Royal Parks that form a chain from the entrance of Kensington Palace through Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, via Hyde Park Corner and Green Park past the main entrance to Buckingham Palace. The park is divided by the Serpentine and the Long Water lakes.\nThe park was established by Henry VIII in 1536 when he took the land from Westminster Abbey and used it as a hunting ground. It opened to the public in 1637 and quickly became popular, particularly for May Day parades. Major improvements occurred in the early 18th century under the direction of Queen Caroline. Several duels took place in Hyde Park during this time, often involving members of the nobility. The Great Exhibition of 1851 was held in the park, for which The Crystal Palace, designed by Joseph Paxton, was erected.\nFree speech and demonstrations have been a key feature of Hyde Park since the 19th century. Speakers' Corner has been established as a point of free speech and debate since 1872, while the Chartists, the Reform League, the suffragettes, and the Stop the War Coalition have all held protests there. In the late 20th century, the park was known for holding large-scale free rock music concerts, featuring groups such as Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones and Queen. Major events in the park have continued into the 21st century, such as Live 8 in 2005, and the annual Hyde Park Winter Wonderland from 2007.", "properties": [{"key": "directions", "name": "Directions", "value": "tube: Lancaster Gate, Marble Arch, Hyde Park Corner or Knightsbridge", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/hyde-park", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "price", "name": "Price", "value": "Free", "ordinal": 4}, {"key": "hours", "name": "Hours", "value": "5AM\u2013midnight", "ordinal": 5}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["district", "sightseeing", "poitype-Park", "relaxinapark", "district-south_kensington-chelsea"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.97241702940085, "poi_count": 99860, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "From Land's End in the south to John O\u2019Groats in the north, there is so much to see in the United Kingdom."}, "object_score": 9.73197890291208}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Park", "short_name": "park", "label": "poitype-Park", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.53187742410372, "poi_count": 1843, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.73197890291208}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Relax in a park", "short_name": "Relax in a park", "label": "relaxinapark", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.53197327296954, "poi_count": 1848, "tour_count": 5, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.73197890291208}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Districts", "short_name": "Districts", "label": "district", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.98367334494397, "poi_count": 46744, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.73197890291208}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "South Kensington-Chelsea", "short_name": "South Kensington-Chelsea", "label": "district-south_kensington-chelsea", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.87908283385246, "poi_count": 1966, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "This district is defined as the southern part of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBK & C), from the Thames in the south to Kensington High Street in the north, also taking in Hyde Park in the east and the area around Kensington Olympia in the west."}, "object_score": 9.73197890291208}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.95977622430187, "poi_count": 9866, "tour_count": 298, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "London is a huge city, so all individual listings are in the appropriate district articles and only an overview is presented here."}, "object_score": 9.73197890291208}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Relax in a park", "short_name": "Relax in a park", "label": "relaxinapark", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.58937482174752, "poi_count": 15392, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.73197890291208}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Park", "short_name": "park", "label": "poitype-Park", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.58931979928426, "poi_count": 15198, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.73197890291208}], "booking_info": null, "attribution": [{"source_id": "openstreetmap", "url": "http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/372975520"}, {"source_id": "wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde%20Park%2C%20London"}, {"source_id": "wikivoyage", "url": "http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/London/South%20Kensington-Chelsea"}], "price_tier": null, "opening_hours": null, "snippet": "The eastern half of the twin parks.", "musement_venue_id": null, "location_id": "London", "location_ids": ["London", "United_Kingdom"], "popular": 0, "hours_spent": 1.5}, {"id": "N__385484295", "name": "Chez Bruce", "coordinates": {"latitude": 51.4459105, "longitude": -0.1657808}, "facebook_id": null, "score": 9.72560334341003, "intro": "Chez Bruce is a restaurant located at 2 Bellevue Road in Wandsworth, London, England.

(/tr\u0259\u02c8f\u00e6l\u0261\u0259r/ ) is a public square in the City of Westminster, Central London, built around the area formerly known as Charing Cross. Its name commemorates the Battle of Trafalgar, the British naval victory in the Napoleonic Wars over France and Spain that took place on 21 October 1805 off the coast of Cape Trafalgar.\nThe site of Trafalgar Square had been a significant landmark since the 13th century and originally contained the King's Mews. After George IV moved the mews to Buckingham Palace, the area was redeveloped by John Nash, but progress was slow after his death, and the square did not open until 1844. The 169ft Nelson's Column at its centre is guarded by four lion statues. A number of commemorative statues and sculptures occupy the square, but the Fourth Plinth, left empty since 1840, has been host to contemporary art since 1999.\nThe square has been used for community gatherings and political demonstrations, including Bloody Sunday in 1887, the culmination of the first Aldermaston March, anti-war protests, and campaigns against climate change. A Christmas tree has been donated to the square by Norway since 1947 and is erected for twelve days before and after Christmas Day. The square is a centre of annual celebrations on New Year's Eve. It was well known for its feral pigeons until their removals in the early 21st century.", "properties": [{"key": "directions", "name": "Directions", "value": "Nearest tube:", "ordinal": 1}, {"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": "11, 12, 15, 159, 15H, 176, 24, 29, 453, 87, 88, 91, N109, N11, N136, N15, N155, N199, N20, N21, N26, N279, N29, N3, N343, N41, N44, N5, N87, N89, N91 (Trafalgar Square / Charing Cross Station); , 139, 6, 9, N113, N18, N550, N551, N9, N97 (Trafalgar Square); 3, N381, N53 (Whitehall / Horseguards Avenue); 94 (Charles II Street)", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "subway", "name": "Subway", "value": "Bakerloo, Northern (Charing Cross); Piccadilly (Leicester Square)", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "train", "name": "Train", "value": "Charing Cross; London Charing Cross", "ordinal": 4}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["district", "sightseeing", "poitype-Square", "district-west_end_of_london"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Square", "short_name": "square", "label": "poitype-Square", "location_id": "London", "score": 8.72571326509139, "poi_count": 144, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.72258932289557}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.97241702940085, "poi_count": 99860, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "From Land's End in the south to John O\u2019Groats in the north, there is so much to see in the United Kingdom."}, "object_score": 9.72258932289557}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.95977622430187, "poi_count": 9866, "tour_count": 298, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "London is a huge city, so all individual listings are in the appropriate district articles and only an overview is presented here."}, "object_score": 9.72258932289557}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Districts", "short_name": "Districts", "label": "district", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.98367334494397, "poi_count": 46744, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.72258932289557}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Square", "short_name": "square", "label": "poitype-Square", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.14199439453976, "poi_count": 527, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.72258932289557}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "West End of London", "short_name": "West End of London", "label": "district-west_end_of_london", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.92452934458838, "poi_count": 1976, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "The West End of London (commonly referred to as the West End) is a district of Central London, west of the City of London and north of the River Thames, in which many of the city's major tourist attractions, shops, businesses, government buildings and entertainment venues, including West End theatres, are concentrated."}, "object_score": 9.72258932289557}], "booking_info": null, "attribution": [{"source_id": "openstreetmap", "url": "http://www.openstreetmap.org/"}, {"source_id": "wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar%20Square"}, {"source_id": "wikivoyage", "url": "http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/London/Leicester%20Square"}], "price_tier": null, "opening_hours": null, "snippet": "The main, central square of London, Trafalgar Square is associated with celebration and demonstration - it is the site of London's lacklustre New Year celebrations, and in 2003 was the site of the triumphant homecoming of the British Rugby team from the World Cup, and a centre for demonstration against Britain's involvement in the Iraq War.", "musement_venue_id": null, "location_id": "London", "location_ids": ["London", "United_Kingdom"], "popular": 0, "hours_spent": 1.0}, {"id": "W__5317958", "name": "Saatchi Gallery", "coordinates": {"latitude": 51.49060939849579, "longitude": -0.1587327109475392}, "facebook_id": null, "score": 9.71709569057731, "intro": "The Saatchi Gallery is a London gallery for contemporary art, opened by Charles Saatchi in 1985 in order to exhibit his collection to the public.

Westminster in central London, England. Built by the impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte with profits from his Gilbert and Sullivan opera productions, it opened on 6 August 1889. It was the first in the Savoy group of hotels and restaurants owned by Carte's family for over a century. The Savoy was the first luxury hotel in Britain, introducing electric lights throughout the building, electric lifts, bathrooms in most of the lavishly furnished rooms, constant hot and cold running water and many other innovations. Carte hired C\u00e9sar Ritz as manager and Auguste Escoffier as chef de cuisine; they established an unprecedented standard of quality in hotel service, entertainment and elegant dining, attracting royalty and other rich and powerful guests and diners.\nThe hotel became Carte's most successful venture. Its bands, Savoy Orpheans and the Savoy Havana Band, became famous, and other entertainers (who were also often guests) included George Gershwin, Frank Sinatra, Lena Horne and No\u00ebl Coward. Other famous guests have included Edward VII, Oscar Wilde, Enrico Caruso, Charlie Chaplin, Babe Ruth, Harry Truman, Joan Crawford, Judy Garland, John Wayne, Laurence Olivier, Marilyn Monroe, Humphrey Bogart, Elizabeth Taylor, Barbra Streisand, Bob Dylan, Bette Midler, The Beatles and many others. Winston Churchill often took his cabinet to lunch at the hotel.\nThe hotel is now managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. It has been called \"London's most famous hotel\". It has 267 guest rooms and panoramic views of the River Thames across Savoy Place and the Thames Embankment. The hotel is a Grade II listed building.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 7836 4343", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "email", "name": "Email", "value": "savoy@fairmont.com",

Gothic abbey church in the City of Westminster, London, England, just to the west of the Palace of Westminster. It is one of the United Kingdom's most notable religious buildings and the traditional place of coronation and burial site for English and, later, British monarchs. The building itself was a Benedictine monastic church until the monastery was dissolved in 1539. Between 1540 and 1556, the abbey had the status of a cathedral. Since 1560, the building is no longer an abbey or a cathedral, having instead the status of a Church of England \"Royal Peculiar\"\u2014a church responsible directly to the sovereign.\nAccording to a tradition first reported by Sulcard in about 1080, a church was founded at the site (then known as Thorn Ey (Thorn Island)) in the seventh century, at the time of Mellitus, a Bishop of London. Construction of the present church began in 1245, on the orders of King Henry III.\nSince the coronation of William the Conqueror in 1066, all coronations of English and British monarchs have been in Westminster Abbey. There have been 16 royal weddings at the abbey since 1100. As the burial site of more than 3,300 persons, usually of prominence in British history (including at least sixteen monarchs, eight Prime Ministers, poets laureate, actors, scientists, military leaders, and the Unknown Warrior), Westminster Abbey is sometimes described as 'Britain's Valhalla', after the iconic burial hall of Norse mythology.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone",

The main site in Covent Garden uses the name of its parent institution, sometimes suffixed by Covent Garden, and is open to the public every day, having reopened in 2007 after a two-year refurbishment. The other site, located in Acton, is known as the London Transport Museum Depot and is principally a storage site that is open on regular visitor days throughout the year.\nThe museum was briefly renamed London's Transport Museum to reflect its coverage of topics beyond London Transport, but it reverted to its previous name in 2007 to coincide with the reopening of the Covent Garden

hotel on Park Lane and Deanery Street in London, to the east of Hyde Park. It is one of the world's most prestigious and expensive hotels. The Dorchester opened on 18 April 1931, and it still retains its 1930s furnishings and ambiance despite being modernised.\nThroughout its history, the hotel has been closely associated with the rich and famous. During the 1930s, it became known as a haunt of numerous writers and artists such as poet Cecil Day-Lewis, novelist Somerset Maugham, and the painter Sir Alfred Munnings. It has held prestigious literary gatherings, such as the \"Foyles Literary Luncheons\", an event the hotel still hosts today. During the Second World War, the strength of its construction gave the hotel the reputation of being one of London's safest buildings, and a host of political and military luminaries chose it as their London residence. Queen Elizabeth II attended the Dorchester when she was a princess on the day prior to the announcement of her engagement to Philip Mountbatten on 10 July 1947. The hotel has since become particularly popular with film actors, models and rock stars, and Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton frequently stayed at the hotel throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The hotel became a Grade II Listed Building in January 1981, and was subsequently purchased by the Sultan of Brunei in 1985. It belongs to the Dorchester Collection, which in turn is owned by the Brunei Investment Agency (BIA), an arm of the Ministry of Finance of Brunei.\nIn the 1950s, the stage set designer Oliver Messel made a number of changes to the interior of the hotel. Between 1988 and 1990, the hotel was completely renovated at a cost of US$100\u00a0million by Bob Lush of the Richmond Design Group.\nToday The Dorchester has five restaurants: The Grill, Alain Ducasse, The Spatisserie, The Promenade, and China Tang. Alain Ducasse's restaurant is one of the UK's five 3-Michelin-starred restaurants. Afternoon tea, a tradition which has taken place at the hotel since its opening in 1931, is served every day of the week at five in the afternoon in The Promenade and the Spatisserie. Harry Craddock, a well-known barman in the 1930s, invented the \"Dorchester of London\" cocktail here at the Dorchester Bar. A well-lit plane tree stands at the edge of the hotel in the front garden, and was named one of the Great Trees of London by the London Tree Forum and Countryside Commission in 1997.", "properties":

Its dining area contains a permanent exhibit of David Shrigley artwork, and Shrigley designed the restaurant's tableware.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 7659 4500", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "9 Conduit Street", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "http://www.sketch.uk.com", "ordinal": 4}, {"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": " (Conduit Street); 22, N22 (Conduit Street / Savile Row); 12, 159, 453, 88, 94, N109, N136, N18, N3 (Conduit Street / Hamleys Toy Store); 113, 139, N113, N137, N15 (Oxford Circus Station); 55, N55 (Oxford Circus); 7, 98, N7, N98 (Oxford Circus Station / Harewood Place); 390, 73, N207, N25, N73, N8 (Great Titchfield Street / Oxford Circus Station)", "ordinal": 5}, {"key": "subway", "name": "Subway", "value": "Bakerloo, Central, Victoria (Oxford Circus)", "ordinal": 6}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["lunch", "coffee", "dinner", "cuisine", "district", "breakfast", "eatingout", "coffeeandcake", "cuisine-Scone", "district-north", "eatingout_time", "cuisine-Dessert", "cuisine-Cocktail", "cuisine-Sandwich", "poitype-Restaurant", "eatingout_establishment", "district-mayfair-marylebone"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Places to eat and drink", "short_name": "Places to eat and drink", "label": "eatingout_establishment", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.97963791519081, "poi_count": 23037, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.89555097045646}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Options for meal times", "short_name": "Options for meal times", "label": "eatingout_time", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.97921349236949, "poi_count": 20112, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.89555097045646}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Cakes and pies", "short_name": "Cakes and pies", "label": "coffeeandcake", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.68667649907304, "poi_count": 298, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.89555097045646}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Places to eat and drink", "short_name": "Places to eat and drink", "label": "eatingout_establishment", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.98882277455127, "poi_count": 147479, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.89555097045646}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Options for meal times", "short_name": "Options for meal times", "label": "eatingout_time", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.98876654110223, "poi_count": 131329, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.89555097045646}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Cakes and pies", "short_name": "Cakes and pies", "label": "coffeeandcake", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.90443449801829, "poi_count": 3844, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.89555097045646}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Cuisine", "short_name": "Cuisine", "label": "cuisine", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.98840279307873, "poi_count": 77164, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.89555097045646}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Restaurant", "short_name": "restaurant", "label": "poitype-Restaurant", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.98550300566777, "poi_count": 82954, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.89555097045646}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Restaurant", "short_name": "restaurant", "label": "poitype-Restaurant", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.97580216086018, "poi_count": 15269, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.89555097045646}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Cuisine", "short_name": "Cuisine", "label": "cuisine", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.97744716065612, "poi_count": 13243, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.89555097045646}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Mayfair-Marylebone", "short_name": "Mayfair-Marylebone", "label": "district-mayfair-marylebone", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.79508725431068, "poi_count": 2098, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "Mayfair is named after a fortnight-long May Fair held from 1686 until banned from that location in 1764.

They became fully operational on 27 August 1939, a week before Britain declared war on Germany. The War Rooms remained in operation throughout the Second World War, before being abandoned in August 1945 after the surrender of Japan.\nAfter the war, the historic value of the Cabinet War Rooms was recognised. Their preservation became the responsibility of the Ministry of Works and later the Department for the Environment, during which time very limited numbers of the public were able to visit by appointment. In the early 1980s the Imperial War Museum was asked to take over the administration of the site, and the Cabinet War Rooms were opened to the public in April 1984. The museum was reopened in 2005 following a major redevelopment as the Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms, but in 2010 this title was shortened to the Churchill War Rooms.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 7930 6961", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "email", "name": "Email", "value": "www.iwm.org.uk", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "Clive Steps, King Charles St, SW1A 2AQ", "ordinal": 4}, {"key": "directions", "name": "Directions", "value": "tube:", "ordinal": 5}, {"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "http://www.iwm.org.uk/visits/churchill-war-rooms", "ordinal": 6}, {"key": "price", "name": "Price", "value": "Adult \u00a319;

United Kingdom, which, as the cathedra of the Bishop of London, serves as the mother church of the Diocese of London. It sits on Ludgate Hill at the highest point of the City of London and is a Grade I listed building. Its dedication to Paul the Apostle dates back to the original church on this site, founded in AD 604. The present cathedral, dating from the late 17th century, was designed in the English Baroque style by Sir Christopher Wren. Its construction, completed in Wren's lifetime, was part of a major rebuilding programme in the City after the Great Fire of London. The cathedral building largely destroyed in the Great Fire, now often referred to as Old St\u00a0Paul's Cathedral, was a central focus for medieval and early modern London, including Paul's walk and St\u00a0Paul's Churchyard being the site of St\u00a0Paul's Cross.\nThe cathedral is one of the most famous and most recognisable sights of London. Its dome, framed by the spires of Wren's City churches, has dominated the skyline for over 300 years. At 365ft high, it was the tallest building in London from 1710 to 1967. The dome remains among the highest in the world. St Paul's is the second-largest church building in area in the United Kingdom after Liverpool Cathedral.\nServices held at St Paul's have included the funerals of Admiral Nelson, the Duke of Wellington, Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher; jubilee celebrations for Queen Victoria; peace services marking the end of the First and Second World Wars; the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer; the launch of the Festival of Britain; and the thanksgiving services for the Silver, Golden and Diamond Jubilees and the 80th and 90th birthdays of Queen Elizabeth II. St Paul's Cathedral is the central subject of much promotional material, as well as of images of the dome surrounded by the smoke and fire of the Blitz.\nThe cathedral is a working church with hourly prayer and daily services.

Founded as the Imperial War Museum in 1917, the museum was intended to record the civil and military war effort and sacrifice of Britain and its Empire during the First World War. The museum's remit has since expanded to include all conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces have been involved since 1914. As of 2012, the museum aims \"to provide for, and to encourage, the study and understanding of the history of modern war and 'wartime experience'.\"\nOriginally housed in the Crystal Palace at Sydenham Hill, the museum opened to the public in 1920. In 1924, the museum moved to space in the Imperial Institute in South Kensington, and finally in 1936, the museum acquired a permanent home that was previously the Bethlem Royal Hospital in Southwark. The outbreak of the Second World War saw the museum expand both its collections and its terms of reference, but in the post-war period, the museum entered a period of decline. The 1960s saw the museum redevelop its Southwark building, now referred to as Imperial War Museum London, which serves as the organisation's corporate headquarters. During the 1970s, the museum began to expand onto other sites. The first, in 1976, was a historic airfield in Cambridgeshire now referred to as IWM Duxford. In 1978, the Royal Navy cruiser became a branch of the museum, having previously been preserved for the nation by a private trust. In 1984, the Cabinet War Rooms, an underground wartime command centre, was opened to the public. From the 1980s onwards, the museum's Bethlem building underwent a series of multimillion-pound redevelopments, completed in 2000. Finally, 2002 saw the opening of IWM North in Trafford, Greater Manchester, the fifth branch of the museum and the first in the north of England. In 2011, the museum rebranded itself as IWM, standing for \"Imperial War Museums\".\nThe museum's collections include archives of personal and official documents, photographs, film and video material, and oral history recordings, an extensive library, a large art collection, and examples of military vehicles and aircraft, equipment, and other artefacts.\nThe museum is funded by government grants, charitable donations, and revenue generation through commercial activity such as retailing, licensing, and publishing. General admission is free to IWM London (although specific exhibitions require the purchase of a ticket) and IWM North, but an admission fee is levied at the other branches. The museum is an exempt charity under the Charities Act 1993 and a non-departmental public body under the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. As of January 2012, the Chairman of the Trustees is Sir Francis Richards. Since October 2008, the museum's director general has been Diane Lees.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 7416 5000", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "email", "name": "Email",

The site also includes the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, an indoor theatre which opened in January 2014. This is a smaller, candle-lit space based on the indoor playhouses of Jacobean London.

It is named after Sir Richard Wallace, who built the extensive collection, along with the Marquesses of Hertford, in the 18th and 19th centuries. The collection features fine and decorative arts from the 15th to the 19th centuries with important holdings of French 18th-century paintings, furniture, arms and armour, porcelain and Old Master paintings arranged into 25 galleries. It is open to the public and entry is free.\nIt was established in 1897 from the private collection mainly created by Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford (1800\u20131870), who left both it and the house to his illegitimate son Sir Richard Wallace (1818\u20131890), whose widow bequeathed the entire collection to the nation. The collection opened to permanent public view in 1900 in Hertford House, and remains there to this day. A condition of the bequest was that no object should ever leave the collection, even for loan exhibitions.

The hotel was originally the idea of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who was the hotel's first managing director. The funding came in large part from the Directors of the Great Western Railway Company, who were persuaded by Brunel to buy shares in the project. The hotel was built on Praed Street in the early 1850s and opened on 9 June 1854 by H.R.H. The Prince Albert, Prince Consort, having taken 14 months to build. The hotel was designed by architect Philip Charles Hardwick, costing approximately \u00a360,000 including all furnishing and fittings - a building which was 'to rival the facilities of the great hotels on the Continent'. The building effectively forms the main fa\u00e7ade of the station, closing off the end of the train shed at the head of the terminal platforms. It was built by Messrs Holland Hannen & Cubitts, the building firm founded by Thomas Cubitt.\nAt Paddington, Hardwick pioneered the Second Empire style for buildings of this type in England. In its original form, the hotel was extensively ornamented inside and outside, and there is a surviving allegorical sculpture in the pediment by John Thomas. The hotel was designed in the style of Louis XIV and further embellished by a figurative sculpture over the front entrance of the hotel representing Peace, Plenty, Science & Industry. Thomas was to contribute many statues and decorations in the present Palace of Westminster.\nThe Great Western Railway originally leased the hotel to a subsidiary, the Great Western Royal Hotel Company, which was chaired by their engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel from 1855 until his death in 1859. Brunel's original idea was that a passenger wishing to travel from London to New York would enter the Great Western Royal Hotel and, from that point, be conveyed by and housed in the various undertakings controlled by the Great Western Company. This never came to pass, however, as the Great Western ship was scrapped before the hotel was completed - after the company had tendered for but failed to obtain the prized Atlantic mail contract, losing it to the Cunard Company.\nThe 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, whose former seat was Stowe House, died as a bankrupt in the hotel in July 1861. The Duke had formerly served as a Conservative Lord Privy Seal in the early 1840s.\nThe railway company took full control of its operation in the later nineteenth century, and in the 1930s extended and remodelled it within and without under the direction of their architect Percy Emerson Culverhouse.\nNorah, Lady Docker, the notorious socialite and spendthrift of the 1940s and 1950s, died in the hotel on 11 December 1983.\nIn accordance with Government policies on privatisation of British Rail, it was sold to the private sector in 1983. It was refurbished and reopened under its present name, as part of the Hilton Hotels chain, in 2001.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 7850 0500", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "email", "name": "Email", "value": "reservations.paddington@hilton.com", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "146 Praed St, W2 1EE", "ordinal": 4}, {"key": "fax", "name": "Fax", "value": "+44 20 7850-0600", "ordinal": 5}, {"key": "directions", "name": "Directions", "value": "at Paddington Stn", "ordinal": 6}, {"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "http://news.google.com", "ordinal": 7}, {"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": "205, 23, 27, 332, 36, 7, N205, N27, N7 (Paddington Station);

Before the Caf\u00e9 was opened, it received more than 10,000 booking requests, with seating filled to the end of the year.

The roof is an important early example of the use of laminated timber to give broad spans. The roof trusses \u2013 some 20m wide \u2013 are as experimented with but replaced at nearby King's Cross Station. Part of the western end of the building was lost to make way for the construction of the new international rail terminal of St Pancras.

It is built on the site of Tottenham Wood and the later Tottenham Wood Farm. Originally built by John Johnson and Alfred Meeson, it opened in 1873 but following a fire two weeks after its opening, was rebuilt by Johnson. Intended as \"The People's Palace\" and referred to as \"Ally Pally\", its purpose was to serve as a public centre of recreation, education and entertainment; North London's counterpart to the Crystal Palace in South London.\nAt first a private venture, in 1900, the owners planned to sell it and Alexandra Park for development. A group of neighbouring local authorities managed to acquire it. An Act of Parliament created the Alexandra Palace and Park Trust. The Act required the Trustees to maintain the Palace and Park and make them available for the free use and recreation of the public forever. The present trustee is the London Borough of Haringey, whose coat of arms shows lightning bolts depicting the Palace's pioneering role in the development of television.\nIn 1935, the trustees leased part of the palace to the BBC for use as the production and transmission centre for their new BBC Television. In 1936, it became the home of the BBC's first regular public television service. The broadcasting system was the 405-line monochrome analogue televisionthe first fully electronic television system to be used in regular broadcasting. Although other facilities soon superseded it after the war, Alexandra Palace continued to be used by the BBC for many years and its radio and television mast is still in use. \nThe original studios 'A' and 'B' still survive in the southeast wing with their producers' galleries and are used for exhibiting original historical television equipment. The original Victorian theatre with its stage machinery also survives and as of 2019, is back in use. The theatre and stage structure is on English Heritage's Buildings at Risk register. Alexandra Palace became a listed building in 1996, at the instigation of the Hornsey Historical Society.\nA planned commercial development of the building into a mixed leisure complex including a hotel, replacement ice-skating rink, cinema, ten-pin bowling alley and exhibition centre, encountered opposition from public groups and was blocked by the High Court in 2007.\nThe Great Hall and West Hall are typically used for exhibitions, music concerts and conferences, operated by the trading arm of the charitable trust that owns the building and park on behalf of the public. There is also a pub, ice rink, palm court, and a panoramic view of central London.\nIn 2013, Alexandra Park was declared a Local Nature Reserve and is also a Site of Borough Importance for Nature Conservation, Grade 1.\nThe nearest railway stations are the London Underground station Wood Green on the Piccadilly line and Alexandra Palace with services from London King's Cross and Moorgate. Alexandra Palace is also served by London Buses route W3.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 8365 2121", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value":

The current crossing, which opened to traffic in 1973, is a box girder bridge built from concrete and steel. It replaced a 19th-century stone-arched bridge, which in turn superseded a 600-year-old stone-built medieval structure. This was preceded by a succession of timber bridges, the first of which was built by the Roman founders of London.\nThe current bridge stands at the western end of the Pool of London and is positioned 30m upstream from previous alignments. The approaches to the medieval bridge were marked by the church of St Magnus-the-Martyr on the northern bank and by Southwark Cathedral on the southern shore. Until Putney Bridge opened in 1729, London Bridge was the only road-crossing of the Thames downstream of Kingston upon Thames. London Bridge has been depicted in its several forms, in art, literature, and songs, including the nursery rhyme \"London Bridge Is Falling Down\".\nThe modern bridge is owned and maintained by Bridge House Estates, an independent charity of medieval origin overseen by the City of London Corporation. It carries the A3 road, which is maintained by the Greater London Authority. The crossing also delineates an area along the southern bank of the River Thames, between London Bridge and Tower Bridge, that has been designated as a business improvement district.", "properties": [{"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": ", 133, 141, 149, 17, 21, 344, 35, 43, 47, 48, N133, N199, N21 (London Bridge); 343, 381, 521, N343, N381 (London Bridge Station)", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "subway", "name": "Subway", "value": "Jubilee, Northern (London Bridge)", "ordinal": 4}, {"key": "train", "name": "Train", "value": "London Bridge", "ordinal": 5}, {"key": "ferry", "name": "Ferry", "value": "RB1, RB6 (London Bridge City Pier)", "ordinal": 6}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["district", "sightseeing", "poitype-Bridge", "district-london_borough_of_southwark"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.95977622430187, "poi_count": 9866, "tour_count": 298, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "London is a huge city, so all individual listings are in the appropriate district articles and only an overview is presented here."}, "object_score": 9.29913747617705}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.97241702940085, "poi_count": 99860, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "From Land's End in the south to John O\u2019Groats in the north, there is so much to see in the United Kingdom."}, "object_score": 9.29913747617705}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "London Borough of Southwark", "short_name": "London Borough of Southwark", "label": "district-london_borough_of_southwark", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.63335769449227, "poi_count": 2480, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "The London Borough of Southwark (/\u02c8s\u028c\u00f0\u0259rk/) in South London forms part of Inner London and is connected by bridges across the River Thames to the City of London."}, "object_score": 9.29913747617705}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Districts", "short_name": "Districts", "label": "district", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.98367334494397, "poi_count": 46744, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.29913747617705}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Bridge", "short_name": "bridge", "label": "poitype-Bridge", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.5355998088263, "poi_count": 2866, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.29913747617705}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Bridge", "short_name": "bridge", "label": "poitype-Bridge", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.28649430119152, "poi_count": 230, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 9.29913747617705}], "booking_info": null, "attribution": [{"source_id": "openstreetmap", "url": "http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/378493707"}, {"source_id": "wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London%20Bridge"}], "price_tier": null, "opening_hours": null, "snippet": "The modern bridge is owned and maintained by Bridge House Estates, an independent charity of medieval origin overseen by the City of London Corporation.", "musement_venue_id": null, "location_id": "London", "location_ids": ["London", "United_Kingdom"], "popular": 0, "hours_spent": 1.0}, {"id": "W__24282400", "name": "Borough Market", "coordinates": {"latitude": 51.50551713387719, "longitude": -0.09054379043632779}, "facebook_id": "165088130222792", "score": 9.29895381536588, "intro": "Borough Market is a wholesale and retail market hall in Southwark, London, England.

It is located at the junction of Poultry and Queen Victoria Street, adjacent to Bank junction, in the City of London financial district. The building was designed by James Stirling for a site which then was owned by developer Peter Palumbo, and first assembled by Palumbo's father, Rudolph, in the 1960s. It was originally intended to be the site of a modernist office tower designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in the manner of the Seagram Building in New York City, but that scheme was aborted following one of the great architectural and planning show-downs of the 1970s. A new design was created, Stirling's final design, in a postmodernist style with an outer shell of bands of rose-pink stone. The structure was built after his death and is considered one of the greatest masterpieces of the postmodernist style in London. In 2016, following proposals to alter it, it received government recognition with a listing at grade II*, making it the youngest listed building in England.\nThe building was owned by Heinrich Feldman until he sold it to Perella Weinberg Partners for \u00a3110 million in 2014.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 7395 5000", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "email", "name":

Although it is common to refer to the entire body of water as the Serpentine, strictly the name refers only to the eastern half of the lake. Serpentine Bridge, which marks the boundary between Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, also marks the Serpentine's western boundary; the long and narrow western half of the lake is known as the Long Water. The Serpentine takes its name from its snakelike, curving shape, although it only has one bend.\nOriginally fed by the River Westbourne and Tyburn Brook in the 1730s, the lake's water was then pumped from the Thames in the 1830s. The water is now pumped from three boreholes within Hyde Park, the most recent being installed in May 2012 as part of the 2011\u20132012 restoration of the Lake. The Serpentine provided a focal point for The Great Exhibition of 1851, and more recently was a venue for the men's and women's triathlon and marathon swimming events in the London 2012 Olympics. Since 1864 the Serpentine Swimming Club has organised a 100-yard race every Christmas morning. In 1913, the Peter Pan Cup was inaugurated for this race by J. M.

When the LCC's successor, the Greater London Council, was abolished in 1986, the Festival Hall was taken over by the Arts Council, and managed together with the Queen Elizabeth Hall and Purcell Room (opened 1967) and the Hayward Gallery (1968), eventually becoming an independent arts organisation, now known as the Southbank Centre, in April 1998.\nThe complex includes several reception rooms, bars and restaurants, and the Clore Ballroom, accommodating up to 440 for a seated dinner. A large head and shoulders bust of Nelson Mandela (by Ian Walters, created in 1985) stands on the walkway between the hall and Hungerford Bridge approach viaduct. Originally made in glass-fibre it was repeatedly vandalised until re-cast in bronze.\nThe complex's variety of open spaces and foyers are popular for social or work-related meetings.\nThe closest tube stations are Waterloo and, across the river via the Jubilee Bridges, Embankment and Charing Cross.", "properties": [{"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/",

It is the venue for some of the most notable events in British culture, in particular the Proms concerts, which have been held there every summer since 1941. It is host to more than 390 shows in the main auditorium annually, including classical, rock and pop concerts, ballet, opera, film screenings with live orchestral accompaniment, sports, awards ceremonies, school and community events, and charity performances and banquets. A further 400 events are held each year in the non-auditorium spaces.\nThe hall was originally supposed to have been called the Central Hall of Arts and Sciences, but the name was changed to the Royal Albert Hall of Arts and Sciences by Queen Victoria upon laying the Hall's foundation stone in 1867, in memory of her husband, Prince Albert, who had died six years earlier.

Monument, is a Doric column in London, United Kingdom, situated near the northern end of London Bridge. Commemorating the Great Fire of London, it stands at the junction of Monument Street and Fish Street Hill, 202ft in height and 202 feet west of the spot in Pudding Lane where the Great Fire started on 2 September 1666. Constructed between 1671 and 1677, it was built on the site of St Margaret, New Fish Street, the first church to be destroyed by the Great Fire. It is Grade I listed and is a scheduled monument. Another monument, the Golden Boy of Pye Corner, marks the point near Smithfield where the fire was stopped.\nThe Monument comprises a fluted Doric column built of Portland stone topped with a gilded urn of fire. It was designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke. Its height marks its distance from the site of the shop of Thomas Farriner (or Farynor), the king's baker, where the blaze began.\nThe viewing platform near the top of the Monument is reached by a narrow winding staircase of 311 steps. A mesh cage was added in the mid-19th century to prevent people jumping to the ground, after six people had committed suicide there between 1788 and 1842.\nThree sides of the base carry inscriptions in Latin. The one on the south side describes actions taken by King Charles II following the fire. The inscription on the east side describes how the Monument was started and brought to perfection, and under which mayors. Inscriptions on the north side describe how the fire started, how much damage it caused, and how it was eventually extinguished. The Latin words \"Sed Furor Papisticus Qui Tamdiu Patravit Nondum Restingvitur\" (but Popish frenzy, which wrought such horrors, is not yet quenched) were added to the end of the inscription on the orders of the Court of Aldermen in 1681 during the foment of the Popish Plot. Text on the east side originally falsely blamed Roman Catholics for the fire (\"burning of this protestant city, begun and carried on by the treachery and malice of the popish faction\"), which prompted Alexander Pope (himself a Catholic) to say of the area:\nWhere London's column, pointing at the skies,\nLike a tall bully, lifts the head, and lies.\n\u2013 Moral Essays, Epistle iii. line 339 (1733\u20131734).\nThe words blaming Catholics were chiselled out with Catholic Emancipation in 1830.\nThe west side of the base displays a sculpture, by Caius Gabriel Cibber, in alto and bas relief, of the destruction of the City; with Charles II and his brother, James, the Duke of York (later King James II), surrounded by liberty, architecture, and science, giving directions for its restoration.\nIt gives its name to the nearby London Underground station, Monument.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 7626 2717", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "email", "name": "Email", "value": "enquiries@towerbridge.org.uk", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "http://www.themonument.info", "ordinal": 4}, {"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": "133, 141, 149, 15, 15H, 17, 21, 344, 35, 43, 47, 48, 521, N133, N15, N199, N21 (Monument Station);

It is jointly owned by the Inner Temple and Middle Temple Inns of Court, bases of the English legal profession. It is famous for being a round church, a common design feature for Knights Templar churches, and for its 13th- and 14th-century stone effigies. It was heavily damaged by German bombing during World War II and has since been greatly restored and rebuilt.\nThe area around the Temple Church is known as the Temple.

Its architect was Inigo Jones, for whom it was a crucial early commission, for Anne of Denmark, the queen of King James I. Queen's House is one of the most important buildings in British architectural history, being the first consciously classical building to have been constructed in the country. It was Jones's first major commission after returning from his 1613\u20131615 grand tour of Roman, Renaissance, and Palladian architecture in Italy.\nSome earlier English buildings, such as Longleat and Burghley House, had made borrowings from the classical style, but these were restricted to small details not applied in a systematic way, or the building may be a mix of different styles. Furthermore, the form of these buildings was not informed by an understanding of classical precedents. Queen's House would have appeared revolutionary to English eyes in its day. Jones is credited with the introduction of Palladianism with the construction of Queen's House, although it diverges from the mathematical constraints of Palladio, and it is likely that the immediate precedent for the H-shaped plan straddling a road is the Villa Medici at Poggio a Caiano by Giuliano da Sangallo. \nToday the building is both a Grade I listed building and a scheduled ancient monument, a status that includes the 115ft, axial vista to the River Thames. The house now forms part of the National Maritime Museum and is used to display parts of their substantial collection of maritime paintings and portraits. It was used as a VIP centre during the 2012 Olympic Games.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 8858 4422", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value":

It is open to the public seven days a week. It reopened on 12 May 2010 following an extensive \u00a31.4m refurbishment.\nThe museum tells the real story of Florence Nightingale, \"the lady with the lamp\", from her Victorian childhood to her experiences in the Crimean, through to her years as an ardent campaigner for health reform. Nightingale is recognised as the founder of modern nursing in the United Kingdom. The new museum explains her legacy and also celebrates nursing today: it is a member of The London Museums of Health & Medicine group.\nIn 1860, four years after her famous involvement in the Crimean War, Nightingale founded the Nightingale Training School for nurses at St. Thomas' Hospital and the museum is located on this site.\nThe new museum is designed around three pavilions that tell her story. The Gilded Cage tells the story of Nightingale's privileged childhood and her struggle against stifling social conventions. The Calling shows how Nightingale and her team coped with the crisis in the military hospitals where the legend of the lady with the lamp was born. Reform and Inspire shows the other side of Nightingale, the reformer who campaigned tirelessly for health reform at home and abroad.\nHighlights from the Collection include the writing slate Nightingale used as a child, her pet owl Athena (which she rescued in Athens and hand reared, and which became her constant companion, travelling everywhere in her pocket), and Nightingale's medicine chest, which she took with her to the Crimean. It contains a mix of medicines and herbal remedies, from bicarbonate of soda to powdered rhubarb. The museum displays a rare Register of Nurses that lists women who served under Nightingale in the military hospitals in Turkey and the Crimean.\nAudio tours are free with entry and accessed via a set of stethoscopes. Interactive exhibits have been created to offer different ways of exploring Florence's story and influence. Free creative activities for children are offered during the holidays.\nThere is also a resource centre which is open by appointment to students, academics and other researchers, who may use the museum's collections, books and documents related to Florence Nightingale. The museum is a member of the London Museums of Health & Medicine.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 7620 0374", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "email", "name": "Email", "value": "info@florence-nightingale.co.uk", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "St Thomas' Hospital, Westminster Bridge Rd", "ordinal": 4}, {"key": "directions", "name": "Directions", "value": "tube:,", "ordinal": 5}, {"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "http://www.florence-nightingale.co.uk", "ordinal": 6}, {"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": "507, 77, C10 (St Thomas' Hospital / A & E Department);  (London Eye); 12, 148, 159, 211, 453, N109, N155, N381, N53 (St Thomas' Hospital / County Hall); 53, 76 (Lower Marsh); 381 (County Hall); A7 (Waterloo Station)", "ordinal": 7}, {"key": "subway", "name": "Subway", "value": "Bakerloo (Lambeth North)", "ordinal": 8}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["museums", "district", "sightseeing", "district-south_bank"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.97241702940085, "poi_count": 99860, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "From Land's End in the south to John O\u2019Groats in the north, there is so much to see in the United Kingdom."}, "object_score": 8.91141432604203}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "South Bank", "short_name": "South Bank", "label": "district-south_bank", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.15579019731501, "poi_count": 350, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "The South Bank has long been associated with the arts."}, "object_score": 8.91141432604203}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Museums", "short_name": "Museums", "label": "museums", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.93211134713477, "poi_count": 4295, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.91141432604203}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.95977622430187, "poi_count": 9866, "tour_count": 298, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "London is a huge city, so all individual listings are in the appropriate district articles and only an overview is presented here."}, "object_score": 8.91141432604203}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Museums", "short_name": "Museums", "label": "museums", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.83799933827047, "poi_count": 613, "tour_count": 26, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.91141432604203}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Districts", "short_name": "Districts", "label": "district", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.98367334494397, "poi_count": 46744, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.91141432604203}], "booking_info": null, "attribution": [{"source_id": "openstreetmap", "url": "http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5741257603"}, {"source_id": "wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence%20Nightingale%20Museum"}, {"source_id": "wikivoyage", "url": "http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/London/South%20Bank"}], "price_tier": null, "opening_hours": {"open_24_7": false, "days": {"sun": [{"start": {"hour": 10, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 17, "minute": 0}}], "mon": [{"start": {"hour": 10, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 17, "minute": 0}}], "tue": [{"start": {"hour": 10, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 17, "minute": 0}}], "wed": [{"start": {"hour": 10, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 17, "minute": 0}}], "thu": [{"start": {"hour": 10, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 17, "minute": 0}}], "fri": [{"start": {"hour": 10, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 17, "minute": 0}}], "sat": [{"start": {"hour": 10, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 17, "minute": 0}}]}}, "snippet": "Tells the story of the Lady with the Lamp.

A \"glorious\" example of Neo-Palladian architecture in London, the house was built and designed by Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington (1694-1753), and completed in 1729. The house and gardens occupy 26.33ha; the gardens were created mainly by architect and landscape designer William Kent. The garden is one of the earliest examples of the English landscape garden.\nAfter the death of its builder and original occupant in 1753 and the subsequent deaths of his last surviving daughter, Charlotte Boyle in 1754, and his widow in 1758, the property was ceded to William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire, Charlotte's husband. After William's death in 1764, the villa passed to his and Charlotte's orphaned young son, William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire. His wife, Georgiana Spencer, a prominent and controversial figure in fashion and politics whom he married in 1774, used the house as a retreat and as a Whig stronghold for many years; it was the place of death of Charles James Fox in 1806. Prime Minister George Canning also died there in 1827 (in a bedroom in the John White wing buildings).\nDuring the 19th century the house fell into decline, and was rented out by the Cavendish family. It was used as an asylum (mental hospital), the Chiswick Asylum from 1892. In 1929, the 9th Duke of Devonshire sold Chiswick House to Middlesex County Council, and it became a fire station. The villa suffered damage during World War II, and in 1944 a V-2 rocket damaged one of the two wings. The wings were demolished in 1956.

It was built between 1365 and 1366, under the direction of William of Sleaford and Henry de Yevele, to house the personal treasure of King Edward III. The original Tower was a three-storey, crenellated stone building which occupied a secluded part of the Palace and was protected by a moat linked to the River Thames. The ground floor featured elaborate sculpted vaulting, described by historian Jeremy Ashbee as \"an architectural masterpiece\". The Tower continued to be used for storing the monarch's treasure and personal possessions until 1512, when a fire in the Palace caused King Henry VIII to relocate his court to the nearby Palace of Whitehall.\nAt the end of the 16th century the House of Lords began to use the Tower to store its parliamentary records, building a house alongside it for the use of the parliamentary clerk, and extensive improvements followed in 1621. The Tower continued as the Lords' records office through the 18th century and several renovations were carried out to improve its fire-proofing and comfort, creating the present appearance of the Tower. It was one of only four buildings to survive the burning of Parliament in 1834, after which the records were moved to the Victoria Tower, built for the purpose of storing archives, and part of the new neo-Gothic Palace of Westminster.\nIn 1869 the Jewel Tower was taken over by the newly formed Standard Weights and Measures Department, which used it for storing and testing official weights and measures. The rising level of passing vehicular traffic made the tower increasingly unsuitable for this work, and by 1938 the department had abandoned it in favour of other facilities. In 1948 the building was placed into the care of the Ministry of Works, which repaired the damage inflicted to the tower during the Second World War and restored the building extensively, clearing the surrounding area and opening the tower to tourists. Today the Jewel Tower is managed by English Heritage and receives about 30,000 visitors annually.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 7222 2219", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "Abingdon Street, SW1P 3JX", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "directions", "name": "Directions", "value": "Opposite the Houses of Parliament", "ordinal": 4}, {"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "http://www.english-heritage.org.uk", "ordinal": 5}, {"key": "price", "name": "Price", "value": "adults \u00a33.90, children \u00a32.30, concessions \u00a33.50", "ordinal": 6}, {"key": "hours", "name": "Hours", "value": "Mo-Su 10:00-18:00", "ordinal": 7}, {"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": " (Parliament Square);

A private residence occupies the third floor and there is a kitchen in the basement. The other floors contain offices and conference, reception, sitting and dining rooms where the Prime Minister works, and where government ministers, national leaders and foreign dignitaries are met and entertained. At the rear is an interior courtyard and a terrace overlooking a half-acre (0.2 ha) garden. Adjacent to St James's Park, Number 10 is near Buckingham Palace, the London residence of the British monarch, and the Palace of Westminster, the meeting place of both houses of parliament.\nOriginally three houses, Number 10 was offered to Sir Robert Walpole by King George II in 1732. Walpole accepted on the condition that the gift was to the office of First Lord of the Treasury rather than to him personally. Walpole commissioned William Kent to join the three houses and it is this larger house that is known as Number 10 Downing Street.\nThe arrangement was not an immediate success. Despite its size and convenient location near to Parliament, few early prime ministers lived there. Costly to maintain, neglected, and run-down, Number 10 was close to being demolished several times but the property survived and became linked with many statesmen and events in British history. In 1985 Margaret Thatcher said Number 10 had become \"one of the most precious jewels in the national heritage\".", "properties": [{"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "10 Downing Street", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/prime-ministers-office-10-downing-street", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": " (Banqueting House);

Since the 1950s it has been associated with British popular music, first via publishers and later by recording studios and music shops. A blue plaque was unveiled in 2014 commemorating the street's importance to the music industry.\nThe street was originally residential, but became used for commercial purposes in the 19th century. At first, metalwork was a popular trade but it became most famous as Britain's \"Tin Pan Alley\" housing numerous music publishers' offices. This market declined in the 1960s to be replaced by music shops and independent recording studios. The Rolling Stones recorded at Regent Sound Studio at No. 4 and popular musicians, including David Bowie and the Small Faces, often socialised in the Gioconda caf\u00e9 at No. 9. Elton John and Bernie Taupin wrote songs at offices on the street in the 1960s, while the Sex Pistols lived above No. 6, and recorded their first demos there.

The museum re-opened in 2017 after an 18-month redevelopment project.\nThe building is largely the Victorian reconstruction of the Church of St Mary-at-Lambeth which was deconsecrated in 1972 and was scheduled to be demolished. It is adjacent to Lambeth Palace on the south bank of the River Thames in London, on Lambeth Road. In 1976, John and Rosemary Nicholson traced the tomb of the two 17th-century royal gardeners and plant hunters John Tradescant the Elder and the Younger to the churchyard, and were inspired to create the Museum of Garden History. It was the first museum in the world dedicated to the history of gardening.\nThe Museum's main gallery is on the first floor, in the body of the church. The collection includes tools, art, and ephemera of gardening, including a gallery about garden design and the evolution of gardening, as well as a recreation of Tradescant's 17th-century Ark. The collections give an insight into the social history of gardening as well as the practical aspects of the subject.

It was originally started in 1981, in a small club at 390 Brixton Rd, and in 1982 above Iceland in Brixton Road with a radical decor that included beat-up ice boxes and artificial dead cats hanging from its ceiling. Early guest DJs included Keith Barker-Main, later a lifestyle journalist and social commentator. It claims to have been the first British club to have such innovations as video screens and a chill out lounge. The Fridge was at the heart of the early 80s New Romantic movement, and booked such acts as Eurythmics and the Pet Shop Boys before they were well known and drew famous faces such as Boy George, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Magenta Devine, as well as Marc Almond and Grace Jones, who also performed there.\nIn 1984, as a result of increased popularity, the club moved to its final location: a converted 1913 cinema (The Palladium Picture House) formerly a roller-disco called the ACE on the Town Hall Parade. Joe Strummer from The Clash invested \u00a35,000 in the new club. Andrew explains during an interview for 3:AM magazine, \"what the club achieved since then -- its visuals laid the template for the rave scene, it's a look that's being copied across the world. There's been no recognition of course -- if a record is influential it's on vinyl for all to hear throughout history, but you can't really encapsulate a visual in the same way, people just take it for granted. Basically the look of modern-day clubs was started here in 1986.\"\nIn July 1985, Andrew and Susan launched their own Record Company, Latex Records. located at the Fridge. Yvette the Conqueror was the first artist signed to the label. The labels first release was a single by Yvette the Conqueror titled, \"The Boys Were There,\" produced by Iain Williams (from the bands You You You and Big Bang. Andrew and Susan also promoted many bands at the Fridge, one of which was the cult club-band You You You featuring club promoter Laurence Malice, Karen O'Connor and Iain Williams. The band performed a sell-out concert at the Fridge on 27 March 1987, at which Andrew had a huge white staircase built on the stage for the band to perform on. The show was filmed for Japanese television.\n Since then it has hosted a variety of club nights most notably Daisy Chain (1987-1990) mostly dance music, trance and more recently mainly hard dance.\nThe Fridge closed on 17 March 2010 and has no link with Electric Brixton which now occupies the building. Electric Brixton opened in September 2011.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 7274 2290", "ordinal": 1}, {"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "1 Town Hall Parade", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": "109, 118, 133, 159, 196, 2, 250, 3, 333, 35, 355, 37, 415, 432, 45, 59, 690, N109, N133, N2, N3, P5 (Lambeth Town Hall);  (St Matthew's Church); 322, P4 (Brixton Station)", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "subway", "name": "Subway", "value": "Victoria (Brixton)", "ordinal": 4}, {"key": "train", "name": "Train", "value": "Brixton", "ordinal": 5}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["dancing", "district", "nightlife", "poitype-Club", "district-brixton"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Dancing", "short_name": "Dancing", "label": "dancing", "location_id": "London", "score": 8.73721584641712, "poi_count": 185, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.73993917657617}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Brixton", "short_name": "Brixton", "label": "district-brixton", "location_id": "London", "score": 7.9446542427916, "poi_count": 376, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "Brixton is a district of South London, England, within the London Borough of Lambeth."}, "object_score": 8.73993917657617}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Club", "short_name": "club", "label": "poitype-Club", "location_id": "London", "score": 8.72736194200594, "poi_count": 179, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.73993917657617}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Dancing", "short_name": "Dancing", "label": "dancing", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.01098740508726, "poi_count": 1467, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.73993917657617}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Club", "short_name": "club", "label": "poitype-Club", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.0106701062966, "poi_count": 1456, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.73993917657617}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Nightlife", "short_name": "Nightlife", "label": "nightlife", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.07722988909098, "poi_count": 47621, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "The legal age to buy alcohol or consume it in a pub is 18, and there are consequences for the bar staff if they serve under-age customers."}, "object_score": 8.73993917657617}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Nightlife", "short_name": "Nightlife", "label": "nightlife", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.04217479266118, "poi_count": 5020, "tour_count": 41, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "London is home to a great many pubs, bars and nightclubs."}, "object_score": 8.73993917657617}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Districts", "short_name": "Districts", "label": "district", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.98367334494397, "poi_count": 46744, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.73993917657617}], "booking_info": null, "attribution": [{"source_id": "openstreetmap", "url": "http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/301886701"}, {"source_id": "wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Fridge%20%28nightclub%29"}], "price_tier": 2, "opening_hours": null, "snippet": "A good atmosphere, very friendly staff as well as quite slow service.", "musement_venue_id": null, "location_id": "London", "location_ids": ["London", "United_Kingdom"], "popular": 0, "hours_spent": 2.0}, {"id": "W__55421655", "name": "Tower Hill Memorial", "coordinates": {"latitude": 51.50956802412924, "longitude": -0.07762276824970187}, "facebook_id": "110489185669949", "score": 8.72777545877587, "intro": "The Tower Hill Memorial is a pair of Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials in Trinity Square, on Tower Hill in London, England. The memorials, one for the First World War and one for the Second, commemorate civilian merchant sailors and fishermen who were killed as a result of enemy action and have no known grave. The first, the Mercantile Marine War Memorial, was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and unveiled in 1928; the second, the Merchant Seamen's Memorial, was designed by Sir Edward Maufe and unveiled in 1955. A third memorial, commemorating merchant sailors who were killed in the 1982 Falklands War, was added to the site in 2005.\nThe first memorial was commissioned in light of the heavy losses sustained by merchant shipping in the First World War\u2014over 17,000 lives were lost and some 3,300 British and Empire-registered commercial vessels sunk as a result of enemy action. The Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) commissioned Lutyens, who initially designed a massive arch on the banks of the River Thames, but this was rejected by the authorities, to Lutyens' disdain. A compromise was struck, as a result of which the memorial was constructed in Trinity Square Gardens on Tower Hill, a site further from the river but with a long maritime history. The site was crown land, meaning a special Act of Parliament was required. Queen Mary unveiled the memorial on 12 December 1928 at a ceremony broadcast live on the radio, her first use of the medium. The memorial is a vaulted corridor reminiscent of a Doric temple and similar to Lutyens' structures in cemeteries on the Western Front. The walls are clad with bronze panels which bear the names of the missing.\nMerchant shipping losses in the Second World War were significantly higher than in the first and the IWGC commissioned a second memorial on the same site, intended to complement the first. Maufe designed a sunken garden, accessed by steps behind the original memorial, the walls of which were again clad with bronze panels with the names of the missing. At regular intervals between the panels are relief sculptures (by Charles Wheeler) representing the seven seas. Wheeler also sculpted two sentries, a Merchant Navy sailor and officer, which stand at the top of the steps. The new memorial was unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II in November 1955, after which relatives of those named on it were invited to lay flowers.\nThe memorials to the world wars are both listed buildings\u2014the Mercantile Marine Memorial is grade I and part of a national collection of Lutyens' war memorials, and Maufe's Merchant Seamen's Memorial is listed at grade II*.

venues, alongside the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal Opera House. Internationally, it is known as the National Theatre of Great Britain.\nFrom its foundation in 1963 until 1976, the company was based at The Old Vic theatre in Waterloo. The current building is located next to the Thames in the South Bank area of central London. In addition to performances at the National Theatre building, the National Theatre tours productions at theatres across the United Kingdom.\nPermission to add the \"Royal\" prefix to the name of the theatre was given in 1988, but the full title is rarely used. The theatre presents a varied programme, including Shakespeare, other international classic drama, and new plays by contemporary playwrights. Each auditorium in the theatre can run up to three shows in repertoire, thus further widening the number of plays which can be put on during any one season.\nIn June 2009, the theatre began National Theatre Live (NT Live), a programme of simulcasts of live productions to cinemas, first in the United Kingdom and then internationally. The programme began with a production of Ph\u00e8dre, starring Helen Mirren, which was screened live in 70 cinemas across the UK. NT Live productions have since been broadcast to over 2,500 venues in 60 countries around the world.\nThe NT had an annual turnover of approximately \u00a3105\u00a0million in 2015\u201316, of which earned income made up 75% (58% from ticket sales, 5% from NT Live and Digital, and 12% from commercial revenue such as in the restaurants, bookshops, etc.). Support from Arts Council England provided 17% of income, 1% from Learning and Participation activity, and the remaining 9% came from a mixture of companies, individuals, trusts and foundations.",

It was designed by Inigo Jones as part of a commission for the 4th Earl of Bedford in 1631 to create \"houses and buildings fit for the habitations of Gentlemen and men of ability\". As well as being the parish church of Covent Garden, the church has gained the nickname of \"the actors' church\" by a long association with the theatre community.\nCompleted in 1633, St Paul's was the first entirely new church to be built in London since the Reformation. Its design and the layout of the square have been attributed to Inigo Jones since the 17th century, although firm documentary evidence is lacking. According to an often repeated story, recorded by Horace Walpole, Lord Bedford asked Jones to design a simple church \"not much better than a barn\", to which the architect replied \"Then you shall have the handsomest barn in England\".\nThe building is described by Sir John Summerson as \"a study in the strictly Vitruvian Tuscan Order\" and \"almost an archaeological exercise\". The description of a Tuscan or Etruscan-style temple by Vitruvius, which Jones closely follows in this building, reflects the early forms of Roman temple, which essentially continued Etruscan architecture, though quite what Vitruvius intended by his account has divided modern scholars. It has been seen as a work of deliberate primitivism: the Tuscan order is associated by Palladio with agricultural buildings.\nThe temple front with a portico on the square has never in fact been the main entrance, although this may have been Jones's first intention. The altar lies behind this wall, and the entrance is at the far end to this. The stone facing of this facade is also later; originally it was apparently brick with stucco. The other sides of the building remain brick, with details in stone. The triangular pediments at both ends are in wood.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 7836 5221", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "Bedford St WC2", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "directions", "name": "Directions", "value": "Tube: .

Co-designed in 1859 by the architect Philip Webb and the designer William Morris, it was created to serve as a family home for the latter, with construction being completed in 1860.\nFollowing an education at the University of Oxford, Morris decided to construct a rural house for himself and his new wife, Jane Morris, within a commuting distance of central London. Purchasing a plot of land in what at the time was the village of Upton in Kent, he employed his friend Webb to help him design and construct the house, financing the project with money inherited from his wealthy family. Morris was deeply influenced by Medievalism and Medieval-inspired Neo-Gothic styles are reflected throughout the building's design. It was constructed using Morris' ethos of craftsmanship and artisan skills and is an early example of what came to be known as the Arts and Crafts movement.\nA number of Morris' friends visited, most notably the Pre-Raphaelite painters Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, both of whom aided him in decorating the House; various Burne-Jones wall murals remain. While at Red House, Morris was involved in the formation of his design company, Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., and embarked on his earliest wallpaper designs. It was also here that his two daughters, Jenny and May, were born. Although initially intending to live there for the rest of his life, Morris found that the house proved too expensive to run and did not suit his lifestyle. After five years, he moved his family to a flat in Queen Square, Bloomsbury and sold the property.\nRed House remained a private residence for various individuals from 1866 until 2002, during which period various alterations were made to the interior design. In 1950 it was designated a Grade I listed building by English Heritage. From 1952 to 1999 the architect Edward Hollamby lived at the House, initiating attempts at preservation and establishing the Friends of Red House charity in 1998. The House was purchased in 2003 for The National Trust, who have since undertaken a project of conservation and maintain it as a visitor's attraction with accompanying tea room and gift shop.",

The centre was developed by the Westfield Group at a cost of \u00a31.6bn,\non a site bounded by the West Cross Route (A3220), the Westway (A40) and Wood Lane (A219). It opened on 30 October 2008 and became the largest covered shopping development in the capital, dethroning the Whitgift Centre in Croydon. After further investment and expansion, it became the largest shopping centre in Europe in March 2018.\nThe centre is in the White City district, where several other large-scale development projects are under way or in the planning stages. The development is on a large brownfield site, part of which was once the location of the 1908 Franco-British Exhibition; the initial site clearance demolished the set of halls still remaining from the exhibition (their cheap-to-build, white-painted blank facades are said to be the origin of the name \"White City\"). Much of the site was in use as a railway depot excavated to a lower level and built over.\nThe centre is noted for its size: it has a retail floor area of 150,000\u00a0m\u00b2 (1.62 million ft\u00b2), the equivalent of about 30 football pitches. At the time of its opening it was reported to be the second largest commercial centre in the UK (after MetroCentre near Newcastle). After an extension opened in March 2018, the centre became the largest in the UK and Europe.\nThe nearest London Underground stations are Wood Lane, White City, Shepherd's Bush and Shepherd's Bush Market.\nThe nearest rail station is Shepherd's Bush, served by suburban London Overground services and by longer distance Southern services between and East Croydon.\nThe mall is anchored by John Lewis, Marks & Spencer, Debenhams, House of Fraser, Next and Primark.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 3371 2300", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "Ariel Way, W12 7GF", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "directions", "name": "Directions", "value": "tube:", "ordinal": 4}, {"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "http://uk.westfield.com/london/", "ordinal": 5}, {"key": "hours", "name": "Hours", "value": "M\u2013Sa 10AM\u201310PM; Su noon\u20136PM", "ordinal": 6}, {"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": "148, 207, 228, 237, 260, 31, 316, 49, 607, C1 (White City Bus Station); , 220, 272, 283, 295, 72, 94, 95, N207, N72 (Shepherd's Bush Station)", "ordinal": 7}, {"key": "subway", "name": "Subway", "value": "Circle, Hammersmith & City (Wood Lane); Central (Shepherd's Bush)", "ordinal": 8}, {"key": "train", "name": "Train", "value": "Shepherd's Bush", "ordinal": 9}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["do", "district", "shopping", "poitype-Shopping_centre", "district-hammersmith_and_fulham"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Shopping", "short_name": "Shopping", "label": "shopping", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.96832343951844, "poi_count": 37252, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "The currency throughout the UK is the pound (\u00a3) (ISO code.

It is the main thoroughfare running south from Trafalgar Square towards Parliament Square. The street is recognised as the centre of the Government of the United Kingdom and is lined with numerous departments and ministries, including the Ministry of Defence, Horse Guards and the Cabinet Office. Consequently, the name 'Whitehall' is used as a metonym for the British civil service and government, and as the geographic name for the surrounding area.\nThe name was taken from the Palace of Whitehall that was the residence of Kings Henry VIII through to William III, before its destruction by fire in 1698; only the Banqueting House survived. Whitehall was originally a wide road that led to the front of the palace; the route to the south was widened in the 18th century following the destruction of the palace.\nAs well as government buildings, the street is known for its memorial statues and monuments, including Britain's primary war memorial, the Cenotaph.

After considering various options (including purchasing Wembley Stadium), the club bought an industrial and waste disposal estate in Ashburton Grove in 2000. A year later, they received the council's approval to build a stadium on the site; manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger described this as the \"biggest decision in Arsenal's history\" since the board appointed Herbert Chapman. Relocation began in 2002, but financial difficulties delayed work until February 2004. Emirates was later announced as the main sponsor for the stadium. The entire stadium project was completed in 2006 at a cost of \u00a3390\u00a0million. The club's former stadium was redeveloped as Highbury Square, an apartment complex.\nThe stadium has undergone a process of \"Arsenalisation\" since 2009 with the aim of restoring Arsenal's heritage and history.

It is situated at the rear (west) of Buckingham Palace, occupying a 42acre site in the City of Westminster, and has two-and-a-half miles of gravel paths. Its area is bounded by Constitution Hill to the north, Hyde Park Corner to the west, Grosvenor Place to the south-west, and the Royal Mews, Queen's Gallery, and Buckingham Palace itself to the south and east. \nThe gardens are Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The planting is varied and exotic, with a mulberry tree dating back to the time of James I of England. The garden covers much of the area of the former Goring Great Garden, named after Lord Goring, occupant of one of the earliest grand houses on the site. It was laid out by Henry Wise and subsequently redesigned by William Townsend Aiton for George IV. Notable features include a large 19th-century lake which was once graced by a flock of flamingoes, and the Waterloo Vase. In the garden there is a summerhouse, a helicopter pad, and a tennis court.\nUnlike the nearby Royal Parks of London, Buckingham Palace Garden is not usually open to the public. However, when the palace is open during August and September, visitors have access to part of the garden, which forms the exit, via a gift shop in a marquee, at the end of the tour. \nThe garden is where the Queen's garden parties are held. In June 2002 she invited the public into the garden for entertainment for the first time during her reign. As part of her Golden Jubilee Weekend thousands of Britons were invited to apply for tickets to Party at the Palace where the guitarist Brian May of the band Queen performed his God Save the Queen guitar solo on top of Buckingham Palace. This concert was preceded the previous evening by a Prom at the Palace.

football stadium in Wembley, London, which opened in 2007, on the site of the original Wembley Stadium, which was demolished from 2002 to 2003. The stadium hosts major football matches including home matches of the England national football team, and the FA Cup Final. The stadium was also the temporary home of Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur between August 2017 and March 2019, while White Hart Lane was being demolished and their new stadium was constructed.\nWembley Stadium is owned by the governing body of English football, the Football Association (the FA), through its subsidiary Wembley National Stadium Ltd (WNSL). The FA headquarters are in the stadium. With 90,000 seats, it is the largest football stadium in England, the largest stadium in the UK and the second-largest stadium in Europe.\nDesigned by Populous and Foster and Partners, the stadium is crowned by the 134m Wembley Arch which serves aesthetically as a landmark across London as well as structurally, with the arch supporting over 75% of the entire roof load. The stadium was built by Australian firm Multiplex at a cost of \u00a3798\u00a0million (\u00a3 billion today). Contrary to popular belief, Wembley Stadium does not have a retractable roof which covers the playing surface. Two partially retractable roof structures over the east and west end of the stadium can be opened to allow sunlight and aid pitch growth.\nIn addition to England home games and the FA Cup final, the stadium also hosts other major games in English football, including the season-opening FA Community Shield, the League Cup final, the FA Cup semi-finals, the Football League Trophy, the Football League play-offs, the FA Trophy, the FA Vase and the National League play-offs. A UEFA category four stadium, Wembley hosted the 2011 and 2013 UEFA Champions League Finals, and will host seven games at UEFA Euro 2020, (including the final and both of the semi-finals), as well as the 2023 UEFA Champions League Final. The stadium hosted the Gold medal matches at the 2012 Olympic Games football tournament. The stadium also hosts rugby league's Challenge Cup final, NFL London Games and music concerts.\nIn 2014, Wembley Stadium entered into a six-year sponsorship agreement with mobile provider EE Limited, under which it provides technology and infrastructure services for the venue. Under the agreement, the facility is officially referred to as \"Wembley Stadium connected by EE\".", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 844 980 8001", "ordinal": 2},

Lion is a Grade II listed equestrian statue of the 12th-century English monarch Richard I, also known as Richard the Lionheart, who reigned from 1189\u20131199. It stands on a granite pedestal in Old Palace Yard outside the Palace of Westminster in London, facing south towards the entrance to the House of Lords. It was created by Baron Carlo Marochetti, an Italian sculptor whose works were popular with European royalty and the nobility, though often less well regarded by critics and the artistic establishment. The statue was first produced in clay and displayed at The Great Exhibition in 1851, where it was located outside the west entrance to the Crystal Palace. It was well received at the time and two years later Queen Victoria and Prince Albert headed a list of illustrious subscribers to a fund that aimed to raise money for the casting of the statue in bronze.\nAlthough the money was duly raised and the bronze cast of the statue was finally completed in 1856, a lengthy dispute delayed its installation for several years. The original idea had been to erect the statue as a memorial to the Great Exhibition. This prompted opposition, as did proposals to place it outside Charles Barry's newly completed Palace of Westminster. Various other locations to display the statue were initially considered before agreement was reached that it would be placed in Old Palace Yard, Marochetti's preferred location. It was installed in October 1860, though it was not until March 1867 that it was finally completed with the addition of bronze bas-reliefs on either side of the pedestal.\nThe quality of the statue's workmanship caused problems during its first half-century; the horse's tail fell off the day after it was installed at the Great Exhibition, and forty years after its installation it was discovered to be riddled with holes and to have never been properly attached to its pedestal.

It holds many drawings and models of Soane's projects and the collections of paintings, drawings and antiquities that he assembled. The Soane Museum is now a national centre for the study of architecture. \nThe museum was established during Soane's own lifetime by a Private Act of Parliament in 1833, which took effect on his death in 1837. Soane engaged in this lengthy parliamentary campaign in order to disinherit his son, whom he disliked intensely. The act stipulated that on Soane's death his house and collections would pass into the care of a Board of Trustees, on behalf of the nation, and that they should be preserved as nearly as possible exactly in the state they were at his death. The museum's trustees remained completely independent, relying only on Soane's original endowment, until 1947. Since that date the museum has received an annual Grant-in-Aid from the British Government via the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.\nFrom 1988 a programme of restoration was carried out, with spaces such as the Drawing Rooms, Picture Room, Study and Dressing Room, Picture Room Recess and others restored to their original colour schemes and in most cases having their original sequences of objects reinstated. Soane's three courtyards were also restored with his pasticcio (a column of architectural fragments) being reinstated in the Monument Court at the heart of the Museum. In 1997 the trustees purchased the main house at No. 14 with the help of the Heritage Lottery Fund. The house was restored and has enabled the Museum to expand its educational activities, to re-locate its Research Library, and create a Robert Adam Study Centre where Soane's collection of 9,000 Robert Adam drawings is housed.\nSome of Soane's paintings include works by Canaletto, Hogarth, three works by his friend J. M. W. Turner, Thomas Lawrence, Antoine Watteau, Joshua Reynolds, Augustus Wall Callcott, Henry Fuseli, William Hamilton and 15 drawings by Giovanni Battista Piranesi, many of which are framed and displayed in the museum. There are over 30,000 architectural drawings in the collection. To this day only 90 visitors are allowed at a time, which often means a queue outside. Labels are few and lighting is discreet; there is no information desk or caf\u00e9.

It crosses the River Thames in a southeast\u2013northwest direction between Vauxhall on the south bank and Pimlico on the north bank. Opened in 1906, it replaced an earlier bridge, originally known as Regent Bridge but later renamed Vauxhall Bridge, built between 1809 and 1816 as part of a scheme for redeveloping the south bank of the Thames. The original bridge was built on the site of a former ferry.\nThe building of both bridges was problematic, with both the first and second bridges requiring several redesigns from multiple architects. The original bridge, the first iron bridge over the Thames, was built by a private company and operated as a toll bridge before being taken into public ownership in 1879. The second bridge, which took eight years to build, was the first in London to carry trams and later one of the first two roads in London to have a bus lane.\nIn 1963 it was proposed to replace the bridge with a modern development containing seven floors of shops, office space, hotel rooms and leisure facilities supported above the river, but the plans were abandoned because of costs. With the exception of alterations to the road layout and the balustrade, the design and appearance of the current bridge has remained almost unchanged since 1907. The bridge today is an important part of London's road system and carries the A202 road across the Thames.", "properties": [{"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": "185, 2, 36, 360, 88, N136, N2 (Vauxhall Bridge / Millbank); 87, N87 (Vauxhall Bridge Road); C10 (Ponsonby Terrace)", "ordinal": 1}, {"key": "subway", "name": "Subway", "value": "Victoria (Pimlico)", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "train", "name": "Train", "value": "Pimlico", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "ferry", "name": "Ferry", "value": "RB2, RB6 (St. George Wharf)", "ordinal": 4}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["district", "sightseeing", "poitype-Bridge", "district-vauxhall"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Districts", "short_name": "Districts", "label": "district", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.98367334494397, "poi_count": 46744, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.34809224153817}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Vauxhall", "short_name": "Vauxhall", "label": "district-vauxhall", "location_id": "London", "score": 7.48633807353545, "poi_count": 117, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "Vauxhall (/\u02c8v\u0252ks(h)\u0254\u02d0l/ ) is a district of South London, England."}, "object_score": 8.34809224153817}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Bridge", "short_name": "bridge", "label": "poitype-Bridge", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.28649430119152, "poi_count": 230, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.34809224153817}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Bridge", "short_name": "bridge", "label": "poitype-Bridge", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.5355998088263, "poi_count": 2866, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.34809224153817}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.97241702940085, "poi_count": 99860, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "From Land's End in the south to John O\u2019Groats in the north, there is so much to see in the United Kingdom."}, "object_score": 8.34809224153817}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.95977622430187, "poi_count": 9866, "tour_count": 298, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "London is a huge city, so all individual listings are in the appropriate district articles and only an overview is presented here."}, "object_score": 8.34809224153817}], "booking_info": null, "attribution": [{"source_id": "openstreetmap", "url": "http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/359177206"}, {"source_id": "wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vauxhall%20Bridge"}], "price_tier": null, "opening_hours": null, "snippet": "The original bridge, the first iron bridge over the Thames, was built by a private company and operated as a toll bridge before being taken into public ownership in 1879.", "musement_venue_id": null, "location_id": "London", "location_ids": ["London", "United_Kingdom"], "popular": 0, "hours_spent": 1.0}, {"id": "N__291659106", "name": "BT Tower", "coordinates": {"latitude": 51.521442459404085, "longitude": -0.1388046906816663}, "facebook_id": "286619184825576", "score": 8.3474226793944, "intro": "The BT Tower is a communications tower located in Fitzrovia, London, owned by BT Group.

This service is an annual event, the first of which took place in 1943 at St Paul's Cathedral and since has taken place in Westminster Abbey.\nThe monument was conceived by Bill Bond, founder of the Battle of Britain Historical Society, who was later appointed an MBE for his services to heritage. He was solely responsible for negotiating with the City of Westminster to secure the site of the monument, as well as appointing Donald Insall Associates as architects. He also formed the fundraising committee after raising over \u00a3250,000 through an appeal. The budget was \u00a31.74 million which was funded in the main by private donations. Bill Bond appointed Lord Tebbit as chairman of the fundraising committee.\nThe monument utilises a panelled granite structure 25m long which was originally designed as a smoke outlet for underground trains when they were powered by steam engines. A walkway was cut obliquely through the middle of the structure, and is lined with panels of high relief sculpture in bronze depicting scenes from the Battle of Britain.

It was first proposed by painter and sculptor George Frederic Watts in 1887, to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The scheme was not accepted at that time, and in 1898 Watts was approached by Henry Gamble, vicar of St Botolph's Aldersgate church. Postman's Park was built on the church's former churchyard, and the church was at that time trying to raise funds to secure its future; Gamble felt that Watts's proposed memorial would raise the profile of the park. The memorial was unveiled in an unfinished state in 1900, consisting of a 50ft wooden loggia designed by Ernest George, sheltering a wall with space for 120 ceramic memorial tiles to be designed and made by William De Morgan. At the time of opening, only four of the memorial tiles were in place. Watts died in 1904, and his widow Mary Watts took over the running of the project.\nIn 1906, after making 24 memorial tablets for the project, William De Morgan abandoned the ceramics business to become a novelist, and the only ceramics firm able to manufacture appropriate further tiles was Royal Doulton. Dissatisfied with Royal Doulton's designs, and preoccupied with the management of the Watts Gallery and Watts Mortuary Chapel in Compton, Surrey, Mary Watts lost interest in the project. Work to complete it was sporadic and ceased altogether in 1931 with only 53 of the planned 120 tiles in place. In 2009, the Diocese of London consented to further additions to the memorial, and the first new tablet in 78 years was added.\nThe Everyday Heroes of Postman\u2019s Park, a now discontinued mobile app, was published in 2013.

parish within the City of London. The church, which is located in Lower Thames Street near The Monument to the Great Fire of London, is part of the Diocese of London and under the pastoral care of the Bishop of Fulham. It is a Grade I listed building. The rector uses the title \"Cardinal Rector\", being the last remaining cleric in the Church of England to use the title Cardinal.\nSt Magnus lies on the original alignment of London Bridge between the City and Southwark. The ancient parish was united with that of St Margaret, New Fish Street, in 1670 and with that of St Michael, Crooked Lane, in 1831. The three united parishes retained separate vestries and churchwardens. Parish clerks continue to be appointed for each of the three parishes.\nSt Magnus is the guild church of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers and the Worshipful Company of Plumbers, and the ward church of the Ward of Bridge and Bridge Without. It is also twinned with the Church of the Resurrection in New York City.\nIts prominent location and beauty have prompted many mentions in literature. In Oliver Twist Charles Dickens notes how, as Nancy heads for her secret meeting with Mr Brownlow and Rose Maylie on London Bridge, \"the tower of old Saint Saviour's Church, and the spire of Saint Magnus, so long the giant-warders of the ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom\". The church's spiritual and architectural importance is celebrated in the poem The Waste Land by T. S. Eliot, who wrote, \"the walls of Magnus Martyr hold/Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold\". He added in a footnote that \"the interior of St. Magnus Martyr is to my mind one of the finest among Wren's interiors\". One biographer of Eliot notes that at first he enjoyed St Magnus aesthetically for its \"splendour\"; later he appreciated its \"utility\" when he came there as a sinner.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 7626 4481", "ordinal": 1}, {"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "Lower Thames St, EC3R 6DN", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "directions", "name": "Directions", "value": "tube:", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "http://www.stmagnusmartyr.org.uk/", "ordinal": 4}, {"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": "133, 141, 149, 15, 15H, 17, 21, 344, 35, 43, 47, 48, 521, N133, N15, N199, N21 (Monument Station);

Museum is an accredited Museum in Kingston upon Thames, southwest London, England. Scottish American philanthropist Andrew Carnegie funded the building of the Museum which adjoins Kingston Library. The Museum runs a lively programme of temporary exhibitions and events and welcomes all visitors free of charge. Built in 1904 the Museum features three permanent galleries. Ancient Origins details the borough's past from prehistory to Anglo Saxon times. Town of Kings charts Kingston's development as a market town from the medieval period until the 1940s. \nHoldings include 120 Martinware ceramics, some of which are on display. The Brill Collection comprises over 110 topographical artworks by Kingston University staff and students. This scheme to record the changing landscape of the borough was the brainchild of Reginald Brill, Head of the former Kingston School of Art, and ran from 1955 to 1971. The Friends of Kingston Museum successfully relaunched the scheme in 1997 and additions to the collection are made annually and displayed as part of a rolling programme in the Art Gallery stairwell.\nOther highlights on display are stained glass windows from the old Town Hall in the Market Place, a Roman altar with inscription, an Anglo Saxon skeleton and a model of Nipper, the dog featured in the \"His Master's Voice\" logo, who was buried under what is now Kingston's Lloyds Bank in 1895.\nThe Eadweard Muybridge Gallery is devoted to the pioneering photographer (1830\u20131904) who was born and died in Kingston. It shows a representative selection of material he bequeathed to the Museum, including over 2,000 glass magic lantern slides and 67 glass zoopraxiscope discs, as well as equipment used by Muybridge during public lectures he gave in the US and Europe in the 1880s and 1890s. Muybridge spent his career in America and there are a number of collections in the US which also hold significant material relating to his work.\n'Muybridge Revolutions' was an exhibition of Muybridge's zoopraxiscope discs held at the Museum from September 2010 to March 2011. Online portal Eadweard Muybridge: Defining Modernities gives information about Muybridge material in collections worldwide.\nThe Art Gallery on the first floor of the Museum hosts a changing programme of exhibitions as well as talks and events.

Sir Edwin Lutyens designed the memorial, which was unveiled on 25April 1925\u2014ten years to the day after the Gallipoli landings, in which the division suffered heavy casualties. Shortly after the war, former members of the division established a committee, chaired by one of their leading officers, Brigadier-General Arthur Asquith, to raise funds for a memorial. Progress was initially slow. The committee planned to incorporate its memorial into a larger monument proposed by the Royal Navy for Trafalgar Square. When the navy abandoned that project, the RND's committee decided to proceed independently. They engaged Lutyens, who, after negotiation with the Office of Works, produced a design for a fountain connected to the balustrade of the Admiralty Extension building.\nLutyens' obelisk rises from a bowl, with water spouts projecting from sculpted lion heads at its base. The bowl is connected to a second, shallower basin by a decorative plinth. The base contains relief carvings of the insignia of units attached to the RND. As well as various dedicatory inscriptions, the base contains the division's battle honours and an excerpt from the poem III: The Dead by Rupert Brooke, who died of disease while serving in the division in 1915. The memorial was unveiled on 25April 1925 by Major-General Sir Archibald Paris, the division's first commanding officer. Winston Churchill, the division's creator, gave a rousing speech praising Lutyens' design and the RND's record of distinguished service.\nThe memorial was dismantled and placed in storage in 1939 to allow the construction of the Admiralty Citadel in the Second World War. It was re-erected in 1951, in the grounds of the Royal Naval College in Greenwich. When the college closed in the late 1990s, a campaign was established to move the memorial back to its original location, where it was unveiled in 2003; Churchill's grandson read out his grandfather's speech from the original ceremony. The memorial was designated a gradeII listed building in 2008 and upgraded to gradeII* in 2015, when Historic England declared Lutyens' war memorials a national collection.", "properties": [{"key":

the London Borough of Camden, close to the boundary with the City of London. It takes its name from Sir Christopher Hatton, a favourite of Queen Elizabeth I, who established a mansion here and gained possession of the garden and orchard of Ely Place, the London seat of the Bishops of Ely. It remained in the Hatton family and was built up as a stylish residential development in the reign of King Charles II. \nSt Etheldreda's Church in Ely Place, all that survives of the old Bishop's Palace, is one of only two remaining buildings in London dating from the reign of Edward I. It is one of the oldest churches in England now in use for Roman Catholic worship, which was re-established there in 1879. The red-brick building now known as Wren House, at the south-east corner of Hatton Garden and St Cross Street, was the Anglican church for the Hatton Garden development. It was taken over by the authorities of a charity school, and the statues of a boy and girl in uniform were then added. \nHatton Garden is famous as London's jewellery quarter and the centre of diamond trade in the United Kingdom (UK). This specialisation grew up in the early 19th century, spreading out from its more ancient centre in nearby Clerkenwell. Today there are nearly 300 businesses here in the jewellery industry and over 55 shops, representing the largest cluster of jewellery retailers in the UK. The largest of these businesses was De Beers, the international family of companies which dominated the international diamond trade. Their headquarters were in an office and warehouse complex just behind the main Hatton Garden shopping street. In 1962 Lawrence Graff of Wittelsbach-Graff Diamond fame opened his first retail jewellery store here.\nSir Hiram Maxim had a small factory at 57 Hatton Garden and in 1881 invented and started to produce the Maxim Gun, a prototype machine gun, capable of firing 666 rounds a minute. Hatton Garden has an extensive underground infrastructure of vaults, tunnels, offices and workshops.

It is situated north of the Hampstead Road Lock of the Regent's Canal (popularly referred to as Camden Lock). Famed for their cosmopolitan image, products sold on the stalls include crafts, clothing, bric-a-brac, and fast food. It is the fourth-most popular visitor attraction in London, attracting approximately 250,000 people each week.\nA small local foodstuffs market has operated in Inverness Street in Camden Town since the beginning of the 20th century. On 30 March 1974 a small weekly crafts market that operated every Sunday near Camden Lock developed into a large complex of markets. The markets, originally temporary stalls only, extended to a mixture of stalls and fixed premises. The traditional Inverness Street market started losing stalls once local supermarkets opened; by mid-2013 all the original stalls had gone, being replaced by stalls similar to those of the other markets, including fast food but not produce.\nThe markets originally operated on Sundays only, which continues to be the main trading day.

Established in 1818 as the Royal Coburg Theatre, and renamed in 1833 the Royal Victoria Theatre, in 1871 it was rebuilt and reopened as the Royal Victoria Palace. It was taken over by Emma Cons in 1880 and formally named the Royal Victoria Hall, although by that time it was already known as the \"Old Vic\". In 1898, a niece of Cons, Lilian Baylis, assumed management and began a series of Shakespeare productions in 1914. The building was damaged in 1940 during air raids and it became a Grade II* listed building in 1951 after it reopened.\nThe Old Vic is the crucible of many of the performing arts companies and theatres in London today. It was the name of a repertory company that was based at the theatre and formed (along with the Chichester Festival Theatre) the core of the National Theatre of Great Britain on its formation in 1963, under Laurence Olivier. The National Theatre remained at the Old Vic until new premises were constructed on the South Bank, opening in 1976. The Old Vic then became the home of Prospect Theatre Company, at that time a highly successful touring company which staged such acclaimed productions as Derek Jacobi's Hamlet. However, with the withdrawal of funding for the company by the Arts Council of Great Britain in 1980 for breaching its touring obligations, Prospect disbanded in 1981. The theatre underwent complete refurbishment in 1985. In 2003, Kevin Spacey was appointed artistic director, which received considerable media attention. Spacey served as artistic director until 2015; two years after he stepped down, he was accused of sexually harassing and assaulting several students. In 2015, Matthew Warchus succeeded Spacey as artistic director.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 844 871 7628", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "103 The Cut, SE1 8NB", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "http://www.oldvictheatre.com", "ordinal": 4}, {"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": "1, 168, 172, 176, 188, 68, N1, N171, N68 (The Old Vic);

"intro": "Her Majesty's Theatre is a West End theatre situated on Haymarket in the City of Westminster, London. The present building was designed by Charles J. Phipps and was constructed in 1897 for actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree, who established the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art at the theatre. In the early decades of the 20th century, Tree produced spectacular productions of Shakespeare and other classical works, and the theatre hosted premieres by major playwrights such as George Bernard Shaw, J. M. Synge, No\u00ebl Coward and J. B. Priestley. Since the First World War, the wide stage has made the theatre suitable for large-scale musical productions, and the theatre has accordingly specialised in hosting musicals. The theatre has been home to record-setting musical theatre runs, notably the First World War sensation Chu Chin Chow and the current production, Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera, which has played continuously at Her Majesty's since 1986.\nThe theatre was established by architect and playwright John Vanbrugh, in 1705, as the Queen's Theatre. Legitimate drama unaccompanied by music was prohibited by law in all but the two London patent theatres, and so this theatre quickly became an opera house. Between 1711 and 1739, more than 25 operas by George Frideric Handel premiered here. Joseph Haydn\u2019s series of concerts in London took place here in the 1790s. In the early 19th century, the theatre hosted the opera company that was to move to the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, in 1847, and presented the first London performances of Mozart's La clemenza di Tito, Cos\u00ec fan tutte and Don Giovanni. It also hosted the Ballet of her Majesty's Theatre in the mid-19th century, before returning to hosting the London premieres of such operas as Bizet's Carmen and Wagner's Ring Cycle.\nThe name of the theatre changes with the sex of the monarch. It first became the King's Theatre in 1714 on the accession of George I. It was renamed Her Majesty's Theatre in 1837. Most recently, the theatre was known as His Majesty's Theatre from 1901 to 1952, and it became Her Majesty's on the accession of Elizabeth II. The theatre's capacity is 1,216\u00a0seats, and the building was Grade II* listed by English Heritage in 1970. LW Theatres has owned the building since 2000. The land beneath it is on a long-term lease from the Crown Estate.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 844 412 4653", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "57 Haymarket, SW1Y 4QL", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "http://www.reallyusefultheatres.co.uk/our-theatres/her-majestys", "ordinal": 4}, {"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": "94 (Charles II Street);

After serving an apprenticeship as a weaver in the City of London, Twining worked for the East India Company merchant Thomas D'Aeth, and became a tea merchant.\nTwining purchased Tom's Coffee Shop, in Devereux Court, off the Strand, in 1706. He subsequently used the premises to sell tea to customers, in addition to the more common coffee, and to sell dry tea to both customers and other nearby coffee shops, such as the Grecian Coffee House - now the site of The Devereux public house - and George's Coffee House across Devereux Court. Tea was then an expensive luxury product. Twining's business was quickly successful, which enabled Twining to expand into adjacent premises on the Strand. By 1717, Twining was trading at 216 Strand, at the sign of the Golden Lyon, where the business remains. The classical door case is surmounted by a pediment with a statue of a golden lion, and two figures of Chinese men who signify the origin of the beverage. The Twining business expanded in 1825 to into a bank that financed tea trading, which operated at 215 Strand from 1835 until it merged with Lloyds Bank in 1892.\nThe tea business became known as \"R. Twining\" after Robert Twining became its director in 1771. Twinings received a Royal Warrant from Queen Victoria in 1837. The Royal Warrant is displayed at the museum. The museum also displays vintage tea caddies, examples of Twinings packaging, and other tea memorabilia and ephemera. The museum explains the history of the Twinings family. \nThe Twinings tea business is now owned by Associated British Foods.", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 7353 3511", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "216 Strand", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "hours", "name": "Hours", "value": "Mo-Fr 09:30-19:30;

The fountain was listed as Grade II in 1952, and in February 2011 reclassified as Grade I.", "properties": [], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["sightseeing", "poitype-Statue"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.95977622430187, "poi_count": 9866, "tour_count": 298, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "London is a huge city, so all individual listings are in the appropriate district articles and only an overview is presented here."}, "object_score": 8.13025637729909}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Statue", "short_name": "statue", "label": "poitype-Statue", "location_id": "London", "score": 8.99953931790231, "poi_count": 425, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.13025637729909}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.97241702940085, "poi_count": 99860, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "From Land's End in the south to John O\u2019Groats in the north, there is so much to see in the United Kingdom."}, "object_score": 8.13025637729909}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Statue", "short_name": "statue", "label": "poitype-Statue", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.19216263330921, "poi_count": 3064, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.13025637729909}], "booking_info": null, "attribution": [{"source_id": "openstreetmap", "url": "http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/16960853"}, {"source_id": "wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana%20Fountain%2C%20Bushy%20Park"}], "price_tier": null, "opening_hours": null, "snippet": "The Diana Fountain in Bushy Park, in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, is a seventeenth-century statue ensemble and water feature in an eighteenth-century setting with a surrounding pool and mile long tree lined vistas which honors the Roman Goddess Diana.", "musement_venue_id": null, "location_id": "London", "location_ids": ["London", "United_Kingdom"], "popular": 0, "hours_spent": 1.0}, {"id": "T__df8a7ea3f004", "name": "The Waldorf Hilton", "coordinates": {"latitude": 51.51272644947682, "longitude": -0.11909321443888121}, "facebook_id": "135011513212339", "score": 8.12804314776245, "intro": "The Waldorf Hilton, London, formerly known as the Waldorf Hotel, is a historic hotel in the Aldwych, London.

Jewels of England, are 142 royal ceremonial objects kept in the Tower of London, which include the regalia and vestments worn at their coronations by British kings and queens.\nSymbols of 800 years of monarchy, the coronation regalia are the only working set in Europe\u00a0\u2013 other present-day monarchies have abandoned coronations in favour of secular ceremonies\u00a0\u2013 and the collection is the most historically complete of any regalia in the world. Objects used to invest and crown the monarch variously denote his or her roles as head of state, Supreme Governor of the Church of England, and head of the British armed forces. They feature heraldic devices and national emblems of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and recent pieces were designed to reflect the monarch's role as Head of the Commonwealth.\nUse of regalia by monarchs in England can be traced back to when it was converted to Christianity in the Middle Ages. A permanent set of coronation regalia, once belonging to Edward the Confessor, was established after he was made a saint in the 12th\u00a0century. They were holy relics kept at Westminster Abbey \u2013 venue of coronations since 1066. Another set was used at religious feasts and State Openings of Parliament. Collectively, these objects came to be known as the Jewels of the Crown. Most of the present collection dates from around 350 years ago when Charles\u00a0II ascended the throne. The medieval and Tudor regalia had been sold or melted down after the monarchy was abolished in 1649 during the English Civil War. Only four original items pre-date the Restoration: a late 12th-century anointing spoon (the oldest object) and three early 17th-century swords. Upon the Acts of Union 1707, the English Crown Jewels were adopted by British monarchs; the Scottish regalia are known today as the Honours of Scotland.\nThe regalia contain 23,578 stones, among them Cullinan\u00a0I (530carat), the largest clear cut diamond in the world, set in the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross. It was cut from the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever found, the Cullinan, discovered in South Africa in 1905 and presented to Edward\u00a0VII. On the Imperial State Crown are Cullinan\u00a0II (317carat), the Stuart Sapphire, St\u00a0Edward's Sapphire, and the Black Prince's Ruby\u00a0\u2013 a large spinel given to Edward the Black Prince by a Spanish king in 1367. The Koh-i-Noor diamond (105carat), originally from India, was forfeited to Queen Victoria and has featured on three consort crowns. A small number of historical objects at the Tower are either empty or set with glass and crystals.\nAt a coronation the monarch is anointed using holy oil poured from an ampulla into the spoon, invested with robes and ornaments, and crowned with St\u00a0Edward's Crown. Afterwards, it is exchanged for the lighter Imperial State Crown, which is also usually worn at State Openings of Parliament. Wives of kings are invested with a plainer set of regalia, and since 1831 a new crown has been made specially for each queen consort. Also regarded as Crown Jewels are state swords, trumpets, ceremonial maces, church plate, historical regalia, banqueting plate, and royal christening fonts. They are part of the Royal Collection and belong to the institution of monarchy, passing from one sovereign to the next. When not in use the Jewels are on public display in the Jewel House and Martin Tower where they are seen by 2.5\u00a0million visitors every year.", "properties": [{"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": ", 15, 15H, N15 (Tower of London); 100, 343, 42, 78, N551 (Tower Gateway Station)", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "subway", "name": "Subway", "value": ", Circle, District (Tower Hill)", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "light_rail", "name": "Light rail", "value": "TG-B (Tower Gateway Platform 1)", "ordinal": 4}, {"key": "train", "name": "Train", "value": "Tower Hill", "ordinal": 5}, {"key": "ferry", "name": "Ferry", "value": "RB1, Red Tour (Tower Millennium Pier); Blue Tour, Green Tour (Saint Katherine's Pier)", "ordinal": 6}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["district", "sightseeing", "poitype-Tower", "district-london_borough_of_tower_hamlets"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Tower", "short_name": "tower", "label": "poitype-Tower", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.3826593645254, "poi_count": 565, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.10670838057085}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.95977622430187, "poi_count": 9866, "tour_count": 298, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "London is a huge city, so all individual listings are in the appropriate district articles and only an overview is presented here."}, "object_score": 8.10670838057085}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "London Borough of Tower Hamlets", "short_name": "London Borough of Tower Hamlets", "label": "district-london_borough_of_tower_hamlets", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.804250589318, "poi_count": 2715, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "The London Borough of Tower Hamlets is a London borough located in East London; it covers much of the traditional East End."}, "object_score": 8.10670838057085}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Districts", "short_name": "Districts", "label": "district", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.98367334494397, "poi_count": 46744, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.10670838057085}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Tower", "short_name": "tower", "label": "poitype-Tower", "location_id": "London", "score": 7.88456153234459, "poi_count": 36, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.10670838057085}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.97241702940085, "poi_count": 99860, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "From Land's End in the south to John O\u2019Groats in the north, there is so much to see in the United Kingdom."}, "object_score": 8.10670838057085}], "booking_info": null, "attribution": [{"source_id": "openstreetmap", "url": "http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3453930443"}, {"source_id": "wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown%20Jewels%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"}], "price_tier": null, "opening_hours": null, "snippet": "Whilst not full of sights, an item of some interest is the coronation stone, on which seven English kings from Edward the Elder to Aethelred the Unready were crowned.", "musement_venue_id": null, "location_id": "London", "location_ids": ["London", "United_Kingdom"], "popular": 0, "hours_spent": 1.0}, {"id": "W__107014761", "name": "Hotel Russell", "coordinates": {"latitude": 51.5231116, "longitude": -0.1241258}, "facebook_id": "621509844564791", "score": 8.10461741782968, "intro": "The Kimpton Fitzroy London is a historic five-star hotel, located on Russell Square, Bloomsbury, in the London Borough of Camden.

Designed and built by Rowland Mason Ordish in 1873 as an Ordish\u2013Lefeuvre system modified cable-stayed bridge, it proved to be structurally unsound, so between 1884 and 1887 Sir Joseph Bazalgette incorporated some of the design elements of a suspension bridge. In 1973 the Greater London Council added two concrete piers, which transformed the central span into a simple beam bridge. As a result, today the bridge is an unusual hybrid of three different design styles. It is an English Heritage Grade II* listed building.\nBuilt as a toll bridge, by Geoffrey Marks, it was commercially unsuccessful. Ownership was incorrectly contested by David Jacobs. The Times of London called Mr Jacobs' ownership claim \"false, ludicrous and demonstrably untrue\". Six years after its opening it was taken into public ownership and the tolls were lifted. The tollbooths remained in place and are the only surviving examples of bridge tollbooths in London. Nicknamed \"The Trembling Lady\" because of its tendency to vibrate when large numbers of people walked over it, the bridge has signs at its entrances that warn troops to break step whilst crossing the bridge.\nIncorporating a roadway only 27ft wide, and with serious structural weaknesses, the bridge was ill-equipped to cope with the advent of the motor vehicle during the 20th century. Despite many calls for its demolition or pedestrianisation, Albert Bridge has remained open to vehicles throughout its existence, other than for brief spells during repairs. It is one of only two Thames road bridges in central London never to have been replaced (the other is Tower Bridge). The strengthening work carried out by Bazalgette and the Greater London Council did not prevent further deterioration of the bridge's structure. A series of increasingly strict traffic control measures have been introduced to limit its use and thus prolong its life. As a result, it is the second-least busy Thames road bridge in London; only Southwark Bridge carries less traffic.\nIn 1992, Albert Bridge was rewired and painted in an unusual colour scheme designed to make it more conspicuous in poor visibility, and avoid being damaged by ships. At night it is illuminated by 4,000 LEDs adding to its status as a landmark.", "properties": [{"key": "ferry", "name": "Ferry", "value": "RB6 (Cadogan Pier)", "ordinal": 1}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["district", "sightseeing", "poitype-Bridge", "district-battersea"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.97241702940085, "poi_count": 99860, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "From Land's End in the south to John O\u2019Groats in the north, there is so much to see in the United Kingdom."}, "object_score": 8.10371392433201}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Districts", "short_name": "Districts", "label": "district", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.98367334494397, "poi_count": 46744, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.10371392433201}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Battersea", "short_name": "Battersea", "label": "district-battersea", "location_id": "London", "score": 7.86603675824357, "poi_count": 517, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "Battersea is a district of South West London, England, within the London Borough of Wandsworth."}, "object_score": 8.10371392433201}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.95977622430187, "poi_count": 9866, "tour_count": 298, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "London is a huge city, so all individual listings are in the appropriate district articles and only an overview is presented here."}, "object_score": 8.10371392433201}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Bridge", "short_name": "bridge", "label": "poitype-Bridge", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.28649430119152, "poi_count": 230, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.10371392433201}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Bridge", "short_name": "bridge", "label": "poitype-Bridge", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.5355998088263, "poi_count": 2866, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.10371392433201}], "booking_info": null, "attribution": [{"source_id": "openstreetmap", "url": "http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/591291859"}, {"source_id": "wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert%20Bridge%2C%20London"}], "price_tier": null, "opening_hours": null, "snippet": "In 1992, Albert Bridge was rewired and painted in an unusual colour scheme designed to make it more conspicuous in poor visibility, and avoid being damaged by ships.", "musement_venue_id": null, "location_id": "London", "location_ids": ["London", "United_Kingdom"], "popular": 0, "hours_spent": 1.0}, {"id": "T__b48fccb4e2f6", "name": "The Biltmore Mayfair", "coordinates": {"latitude": 51.51058234919685, "longitude": -0.15098090078394735}, "facebook_id": "152933778060185", "score": 8.10198859561012, "intro": "The Biltmore Mayfair is a 5-star luxury hotel located at 44 Grosvenor Square in the Mayfair area of London, England.

statues depicting firefighters in action at the height of the Blitz. It is located on the Jubilee Walkway to the south of St Paul's Cathedral in the City of London, and it is approachable from the south bank of the River Thames via the Millennium Footbridge.\nThe monument, originally the concept of Cyril Demarne, was commissioned by the Firefighters Memorial Charitable Trust set up in 1990. It was sculpted by John W. Mills. Initially, the structure was intended as a tribute to those men and women who fought so gallantly against fire on the streets of London during the Blitz of World War II, when the city was struck by bombs on 57 consecutive nights in a sustained campaign of bombing. It also served as a monument to commemorate the service of firefighters throughout the war. Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother unveiled the memorial on 4 May 1991.\nIt was decided in 1998 to make the memorial a national monument that would commemorate not just the firefighters who died in World War II, but the lives of all firefighters throughout the United Kingdom who were killed in the line of duty. The National Firefighters Memorial was moved from its original site in Old Change Court, the plinth was elevated by a little over 1 m, and the names of all those killed in peacetime were added.\nThe Princess Royal, patron of the Firefighters' Memorial Charitable Trust, attended a service and ceremony of re-dedication on 16 September 2003. A total of 1,192 names were inscribed in bronze onto the memorial.\nA service of remembrance is held at the memorial annually on the Sunday closest to 7 September, the anniversary of the start of the Blitz.", "properties": [{"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "Sermon Lane", "ordinal": 1}, {"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": ", 11, 15, 15H, 17, 26, 76, N11, N15, N199, N21, N26, N550, N551 (St Paul's Cathedral); 4 (Millennium Bridge); 521 (New Change / Cannon Street); 100, 25, 56, 8, N242, N25, N8 (St Paul's Station)", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "subway", "name": "Subway", "value": ", Circle, District (Mansion House); Central (St. Paul's Central Line Westbound)", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "train", "name": "Train", "value": "Mansion House; City Thameslink", "ordinal": 4}, {"key": "ferry", "name": "Ferry", "value": "RB1, RB6 (Blackfriars Pier)", "ordinal": 5}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["sightseeing", "poitype-Memorial"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Memorial", "short_name": "memorial", "label": "poitype-Memorial", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.19582173239768, "poi_count": 6179, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.09706981820297}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.97241702940085, "poi_count": 99860, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "From Land's End in the south to John O\u2019Groats in the north, there is so much to see in the United Kingdom."}, "object_score": 8.09706981820297}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Memorial", "short_name": "memorial", "label": "poitype-Memorial", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.12531406935459, "poi_count": 868, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.09706981820297}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.95977622430187, "poi_count": 9866, "tour_count": 298, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "London is a huge city, so all individual listings are in the appropriate district articles and only an overview is presented here."}, "object_score": 8.09706981820297}], "booking_info": null, "attribution": [{"source_id": "openstreetmap", "url": "http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/441950766"}, {"source_id": "wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National%20Firefighters%20Memorial"}], "price_tier": null, "opening_hours": null, "snippet": "The National Firefighters Memorial was moved from its original site in Old Change Court, the plinth was elevated by a little over 1 m, and the names of all those killed in peacetime were added.", "musement_venue_id": null, "location_id": "London", "location_ids": ["London", "United_Kingdom"], "popular": 0, "hours_spent": 1.0}, {"id": "T__c993a472b329", "name": "The Tower Hotel", "coordinates": {"latitude": 51.50659406639066, "longitude": -0.07312844979801399}, "facebook_id": "509373422418893", "score": 8.09646982560006, "intro": "The Tower Hotel is a large hotel situated on the north bank of the River Thames, on the east side of Tower Bridge, in London.\nThe hotel was designed by the Renton Howard Wood Partnership, and constructed by Taylor Woodrow for owners J.

It became more down-market in the late 18th century as Leicester House was demolished and retail developments took place, becoming a centre for entertainment. Several major theatres were built in the 19th century, which were converted to cinemas towards the middle of the next. Leicester Square holds a number of nationally significant cinemas such as the Odeon Leicester Square, Empire, Leicester Square, which are often used for film premieres (and the now closed Odeon West End). The nearby Prince Charles Cinema is known for its screenings of cult films and marathon film runs. The square remains a tourist attraction which hosts events, including for the Chinese New Year.\nThe square has always had a park in its centre, which was originally Lammas land. The park's fortunes have varied over the centuries, reaching near dilapidation in the mid-19th century after changing ownership several times. It was restored under the direction of Albert Grant, which included the construction of four new statues and a fountain of William Shakespeare.

is a public garden in central London, a short distance north of St Paul's Cathedral. Bordered by Little Britain, Aldersgate Street, St. Martin's Le Grand, King Edward Street, and the site of the former headquarters of the General Post Office (GPO), it is one of the largest open spaces in the City of London, the walled city which gives its name to modern London.\nPostman's Park opened in 1880 on the site of the former churchyard and burial ground of St Botolph's Aldersgate church and expanded over the next 20\u00a0years to incorporate the adjacent burial grounds of Christ Church Greyfriars and St Leonard, Foster Lane, together with the site of housing demolished during the widening of Little Britain in 1880; the ownership of the last location became the subject of a lengthy dispute between the church authorities, the General Post Office, the Treasury, and the City Parochial Foundation. A shortage of space for burials in London meant that corpses were often laid on the ground and covered over with soil, thus elevating the park above the streets which surround it.\nIn 1900, the park became the location for George Frederic Watts's Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice, a memorial to ordinary people who died while saving the lives of others and who might otherwise be forgotten, in the form of a loggia and long wall housing ceramic memorial tablets. Only four of the planned 120 memorial tablets were in place at the time of its opening, with a further nine tablets added during Watts's lifetime. Watts's wife, Mary Watts, took over the management of the project after Watts's death in 1904 and oversaw the installation of a further 35 memorial tablets in the following four years along with a small monument to Watts. Later she became disillusioned with the new tile manufacturer and, with her time and money increasingly occupied by the running of the Watts Gallery, she lost interest in the project, and only five further tablets were added during her lifetime.\nIn 1972, key elements of the park, including the Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice, were grade II listed to preserve their character, upgraded to Grade II* in 2018. Following the 2004 film Closer, based on the 1997 play Closer by Patrick Marber, Postman's Park experienced a resurgence of interest; key scenes of both were set in the park itself.

Built entirely using traditional methods and materials, the Swaminarayan mandir has been described as being Britain's first authentic Hindu temple. It was also Europe's first traditional Hindu stone temple, as distinct from converted secular buildings. It is a part of the Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS) organisation and was inaugurated in 1995 by Pramukh Swami Maharaj.\nThe mandir was cited in Guinness World Records 2000, as follows:\nBiggest Hindu Temple outside India: The Shri Swaminarayan Temple in Neasden, London, UK, is the largest Hindu temple outside India. It was built by Pramukh Swami, a 92-year-old Indian sadhu, and is made of 2,828 tonnes of Bulgarian limestone and 2,000 tonnes of Italian marble, which was first shipped to India to be carved by a team of 1,526 sculptors. The temple cost \u00a312\u00a0million to build.\nHowever, since 2000 it has been surpassed in size by other BAPS mandirs elsewhere. The mandir was built and funded entirely by the Hindu community. The entire project spanned five years although the mandir construction itself was completed in two-and-a-half years. Building work began in August 1992. In November 1992, the temple recorded the largest concrete-pour in the UK, when 4,500 tons were put down in 24 hours to create a foundation mat 1.8m thick. The first stone was laid in June 1993; two years later, the building was complete.\nThe temple complex consists of:\n* a mandir, constructed mainly from hand-carved Italian Carrara marble and Bulgarian limestone\n* a permanent exhibition entitled, \"Understanding Hinduism\"\n* the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Haveli, a cultural centre housing an assembly hall, gymnasium, bookshop, and offices", "properties": [{"key": "phone", "name": "Phone", "value": "+44 20 8965 2651", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "email", "name": "Email", "value": "info@londonmandir.baps.org", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "105-119 Brentfield Road, Neasden, London NW10 8LD", "ordinal": 4}, {"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "http://londonmandir.baps.org", "ordinal": 5}, {"key": "price", "name": "Price", "value": "Free", "ordinal": 6}, {"key": "hours", "name": "Hours", "value": "M-Su 9AM-6PM", "ordinal": 7}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["district", "sightseeing", "district-north", "poitype-Temple"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.97241702940085, "poi_count": 99860, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "From Land's End in the south to John O\u2019Groats in the north, there is so much to see in the United Kingdom."}, "object_score": 8.08230582544261}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Temple", "short_name": "temple", "label": "poitype-Temple", "location_id": "London", "score": 6.79130899351786, "poi_count": 60, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.08230582544261}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "North", "short_name": "North", "label": "district-north", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.87626808160413, "poi_count": 4717, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "Many outer areas of North London were once part of the county of Middlesex, which no longer exists for administrative purposes."}, "object_score": 8.08230582544261}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Districts", "short_name": "Districts", "label": "district", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.98367334494397, "poi_count": 46744, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.08230582544261}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Temple", "short_name": "temple", "label": "poitype-Temple", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 7.60566806991523, "poi_count": 278, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.08230582544261}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.95977622430187, "poi_count": 9866, "tour_count": 298, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "London is a huge city, so all individual listings are in the appropriate district articles and only an overview is presented here."}, "object_score": 8.08230582544261}], "booking_info": null, "attribution": [{"source_id": "openstreetmap", "url": "http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/4128586"}, {"source_id": "wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAPS%20Shri%20Swaminarayan%20Mandir%20London"}, {"source_id": "wikivoyage", "url": "http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/London/North"}], "price_tier": null, "opening_hours": {"open_24_7": false, "days": {"sun": [{"start": {"hour": 9, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 18, "minute": 0}}], "mon": [{"start": {"hour": 9, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 18, "minute": 0}}], "tue": [{"start": {"hour": 9, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 18, "minute": 0}}], "wed": [{"start": {"hour": 9, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 18, "minute": 0}}], "thu": [{"start": {"hour": 9, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 18, "minute": 0}}], "fri": [{"start": {"hour": 9, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 18, "minute": 0}}], "sat": [{"start": {"hour": 9, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 18, "minute": 0}}]}}, "snippet": "It's Europe\u2019s first mandir, a traditional Hindu stone temple.

The Albert Memorial was constructed in the 1860s in memory of Prince Albert, the husband of Queen Victoria.\nThe frieze is named after Mount Parnassus, the favorite resting place in Ancient Greek mythology for the muses. It contains 169 life-size full-length sculptures, a mixture of low-relief and high-relief, of individual composers, architects, poets, painters, and sculptors from history. The depictions of earlier figures necessarily, were imaginary, although many of the figures were based on materials contained in a collection of artworks and drawings gathered for the purpose of ensuring authentic depictions, where this was possible.\nThe total length of the frieze is approximately 64 metres (210 feet). The frieze was intended to be the 'soul' of the memorial, and the memorial's designer, George Gilbert Scott, stated that he was inspired by the H\u00e9micycle des Beaux Arts by Paul Delaroche. The memorial was not laid out precisely to directions of the compass, however, closely enough that the sides are referred to by direction. Musicians and poets were placed on the south side, with painters on the east side, sculptors on the west side, and architects on the north side.\nHenry Hugh Armstead carved the figures on the south and east sides, the painters, musicians, and poets (80 in total), and grouped them by national schools. John Birnie Philip carved the figures on the west and north sides, the sculptors and architects (89 named figures, plus two generic figures), and arranged them in chronological order.\nThe carving was executed in situ, and was said by Scott to be \"perhaps one of the most laborious works of sculpture ever undertaken\". The initial contracts, agreed around 1864, had specified that the work was to be completed in four years for \u00a37,781 15s. The eventual cost, however, exceeded this by some \u00a32,000 and the work was not finished until 1872.\nLarge groups of figures of eminent persons from the past often decorate public buildings and monuments of the later nineteenth century, and some buildings such as the Walhalla temple in Bavaria and the Panth\u00e9on in Paris were dedicated to this purpose. Many figures of visual artists decorate the Victoria and Albert Museum close to the Albert Memorial at the other end of the \"Albertopolis\" complex. A mosaic frieze of more generalised figures from the arts runs round the circular Royal Albert Hall adjacent to the memorial. The Parnassus by Raphael (1511), opposite the philosophers of The School of Athens in the Vatican Raphael Rooms, is an earlier group portrait of great artists.", "properties": [], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["district", "sightseeing", "poitype-Statue", "district-south_kensington-chelsea"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Statue", "short_name": "statue", "label": "poitype-Statue", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.19216263330921, "poi_count": 3064, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.05459111916479}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.97241702940085, "poi_count": 99860, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "From Land's End in the south to John O\u2019Groats in the north, there is so much to see in the United Kingdom."}, "object_score": 8.05459111916479}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Statue", "short_name": "statue", "label": "poitype-Statue", "location_id": "London", "score": 8.99953931790231, "poi_count": 425, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.05459111916479}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "South Kensington-Chelsea", "short_name": "South Kensington-Chelsea", "label": "district-south_kensington-chelsea", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.87908283385246, "poi_count": 1966, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "This district is defined as the southern part of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBK & C), from the Thames in the south to Kensington High Street in the north, also taking in Hyde Park in the east and the area around Kensington Olympia in the west."}, "object_score": 8.05459111916479}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.95977622430187, "poi_count": 9866, "tour_count": 298, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "London is a huge city, so all individual listings are in the appropriate district articles and only an overview is presented here."}, "object_score": 8.05459111916479}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Districts", "short_name": "Districts", "label": "district", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.98367334494397, "poi_count": 46744, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.05459111916479}], "booking_info": null, "attribution": [{"source_id": "openstreetmap", "url": "http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/690961188"}, {"source_id": "wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieze%20of%20Parnassus"}], "price_tier": null, "opening_hours": null, "snippet": "The depictions of earlier figures necessarily, were imaginary, although many of the figures were based on materials contained in a collection of artworks and drawings gathered for the purpose of ensuring authentic depictions, where this was possible.", "musement_venue_id": null, "location_id": "London", "location_ids": ["London", "United_Kingdom"], "popular": 0, "hours_spent": 1.0}, {"id": "N__470628776", "name": "Lloyd's building", "coordinates": {"latitude": 51.5126694, "longitude": -0.0823281}, "facebook_id": "533835880057447", "score": 8.05191913117167, "intro": "The Lloyd's building (sometimes known as the Inside-Out Building) is the home of the insurance institution Lloyd's of London.

Today, the models are notable for representing the scientific inaccuracies of early paleontology, the result of improperly reconstructed fossils and the nascent nature of the science in the 19th century, with the Iguanodon model being particularly singled out.", "properties": [{"key": "train", "name": "Train", "value": "Crystal Palace", "ordinal": 1}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["sightseeing", "poitype-Statue"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Statue", "short_name": "statue", "label": "poitype-Statue", "location_id": "London", "score": 8.99953931790231, "poi_count": 425, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.04735925673286}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.95977622430187, "poi_count": 9866, "tour_count": 298, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "London is a huge city, so all individual listings are in the appropriate district articles and only an overview is presented here."}, "object_score": 8.04735925673286}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.97241702940085, "poi_count": 99860, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "From Land's End in the south to John O\u2019Groats in the north, there is so much to see in the United Kingdom."}, "object_score": 8.04735925673286}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Statue", "short_name": "statue", "label": "poitype-Statue", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.19216263330921, "poi_count": 3064, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.04735925673286}], "booking_info": null, "attribution": [{"source_id": "openstreetmap", "url": "http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1379942457"}, {"source_id": "wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal%20Palace%20Dinosaurs"}], "price_tier": null, "opening_hours": null, "snippet": "The Crystal Palace Dinosaurs are a series of sculptures of dinosaurs and other extinct animals, incorrect by modern standards, in the London borough of Bromley's Crystal Palace Park.", "musement_venue_id": null, "location_id": "London", "location_ids": ["London", "United_Kingdom"], "popular": 0, "hours_spent": 1.0}, {"id": "W__27163672", "name": "Lyceum Theatre", "coordinates": {"latitude": 51.511495360640914, "longitude": -0.12006244008767523}, "facebook_id": "208948062588916", "score": 8.04689007219105, "intro": "The Lyceum Theatre (pronounced ly-CEE-um) is a 2,100-seat West End theatre located in the City of Westminster, on Wellington Street, just off the Strand. The origins of the theatre date to 1765. Managed by Samuel Arnold, from 1794 to 1809 the building hosted a variety of entertainments including a circus produced by Philip Astley, a chapel, and the first London exhibition of waxworks displayed by Madame Tussaud. From 1816 to 1830, it served as The English Opera House. After a fire, the house was rebuilt and reopened on 14 July 1834 to a design by Samuel Beazley. The building was unique in that it has a balcony overhanging the dress circle. It was built by the partnership of Peto & Grissell. The theatre then played opera, adaptations of Charles Dickens novels and James Planch\u00e9's \"fairy extravaganzas\", among other works.\nFrom 1871 to 1902, Henry Irving appeared at the theatre in, especially, Shakespeare, usually starring opposite Ellen Terry. In 1904 the theatre was almost completely rebuilt and richly ornamented in Rococo style by Bertie Crewe, but it retained Beazley's fa\u00e7ade and grand portico. It played mostly melodrama over the ensuing decades. The building closed in 1939 and was set to be demolished, but it was saved and converted into a Mecca Ballroom in 1951, styled the Lyceum Ballroom, where many well-known bands played. The Lyceum was closed in 1986 but restored to theatrical use in 1996 by Holohan Architects. Since 1999, the theatre has hosted The Lion King.", "properties": [{"key": "address", "name": "Address", "value": "21 Wellington Street, WC2E 7RQ", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "http://www.thelyceumtheatre.com/", "ordinal": 3}, {"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": "11, 139, 15, 15H, 176, 6, 87, 9, 91, N11, N15, N155, N199, N21, N26, N343, N44, N550, N551, N87, N89, N9, N91 (Savoy Street);

It was sculpted by Victoria's fourth daughter Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll and erected in 1893 . The statue was made from white marble on a Portland stone base. It depicts Victoria aged 18, seated in her coronation robes, resembling the painting of Victoria at her coronation by Sir George Hayter. The statue received a Grade II listing in 1969.\nVictoria was born in Kensington Palace in May 1819, and spent most of her early life there until she ascended to the throne in 1837. The statue was made to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887 but took some years to complete. It was commissioned by the Kensington Golden Jubilee Memorial Executive Committee, who sought design proposals. Princess Louise was reluctant to take up a commission to sculpt her mother, but was persuaded to make a model by her friend, the artist Lawrence Alma Tadema. She submitted her entry anonymously, and it was selected by the judging panel. Princess Louise was herself resident at Kensington Palace, and she sculpted the statue at her studio there (although some press reports suggested it was made by her tutor Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm). The completed sculpture was unveiled by Queen Victoria on 28 June 1893.\nThe statue suffered bomb damage during the Second World War, with shrapnel removing its nose in 1945. The damaged nose replaced before the accession of Queen Elizabeth II in 1952, and the nose was replaced a second time for the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2012.\nA bronze casting of the statue stands in front of the Royal Victoria College, Montreal, now the Strathcona Music Building of McGill University. The replica was commissioned by Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal, founder of Royal Victoria College, and unveiled in 1900 by Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto, then Governor General of Canada.", "properties": [], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["district", "sightseeing", "poitype-Memorial", "district-south_kensington-chelsea"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Memorial", "short_name": "memorial", "label": "poitype-Memorial", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.12531406935459, "poi_count": 868, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.02483843111635}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.97241702940085, "poi_count": 99860, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "From Land's End in the south to John O\u2019Groats in the north, there is so much to see in the United Kingdom."}, "object_score": 8.02483843111635}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Memorial", "short_name": "memorial", "label": "poitype-Memorial", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.19582173239768, "poi_count": 6179, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.02483843111635}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.95977622430187, "poi_count": 9866, "tour_count": 298, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "London is a huge city, so all individual listings are in the appropriate district articles and only an overview is presented here."}, "object_score": 8.02483843111635}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "South Kensington-Chelsea", "short_name": "South Kensington-Chelsea", "label": "district-south_kensington-chelsea", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.87908283385246, "poi_count": 1966, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "This district is defined as the southern part of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBK & C), from the Thames in the south to Kensington High Street in the north, also taking in Hyde Park in the east and the area around Kensington Olympia in the west."}, "object_score": 8.02483843111635}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Districts", "short_name": "Districts", "label": "district", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.98367334494397, "poi_count": 46744, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 8.02483843111635}], "booking_info": null, "attribution": [{"source_id": "openstreetmap", "url": "http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5352928184"}, {"source_id": "wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue%20of%20Queen%20Victoria%2C%20Kensington%20Palace"}], "price_tier": null, "opening_hours": null, "snippet": "A statue of Queen Victoria stands near Kensington Palace.", "musement_venue_id": null, "location_id": "London", "location_ids": ["London", "United_Kingdom"], "popular": 0, "hours_spent": 1.0}, {"id": "T__12eb6fc8309e", "name": "Covent Garden Piazza", "coordinates": {"latitude": 51.5116247, "longitude": -0.1237967}, "facebook_id": "608603862543075", "score": 8.02282785584493, "intro": "Once an important working market, and the backdrop for the musical My Fair Lady, Covent Garden today is a covered shopping mall with shops predominantly selling clothing, but also gifts and cosmetics, as well as stalls selling handicrafts (Tu-Su) or antiques (M), and restaurants.

Russell Square tube station sits to the north-east.\nIt is named after the surname of the Earls and Dukes of Bedford; the freehold remains with the latter's conservation trusts who have agreed public access and management by Camden Council.

Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and unveiled in 1924, the memorial commemorates the 1,240 members of the Prince of Wales' Own Civil Service Rifles regiment who were killed in the First World War. They were Territorial Force reservists, drawn largely from the British Civil Service, which at that time had many staff based at Somerset House.\nBoth battalions of the expanded Civil Service Rifles were disbanded shortly after the war; the regiment amalgamated with the Queen's Westminster Rifles, but former members established an Old Comrades Association to keep the regiment's traditions alive. The association began raising funds for a war memorial in 1920, and the Prince of Wales unveiled the memorial on 27 January 1924. It takes the form of a single rectangular column surmounted by a sculpture of an urn and flanked by painted stone flags, the Union Flag on one side and the regimental colour on the other. The base on which the column stands is inscribed with the regiment's battle honours, while an inscription on the column denotes that a scroll containing the names of the fallen was placed inside.\nThe memorial first stood in the quadrangle of Somerset House, which the Civil Service Rifles had used as a parade ground, but the civil service began to vacate Somerset House towards the end of the 20th century. As the building and its courtyard were re-purposed, the memorial was moved to the riverside terrace in the late 1990s. Members of the regiment continued to attend Remembrance Sunday ceremonies until at least the late 1980s, by which time many former members were in their nineties; the last known surviving member of the regiment attended a rededication ceremony in 2002. The memorial was designated a grade II listed building in 1987, which was upgraded to grade II* in November 2015 when it became part of a national collection of Lutyens' war memorials.", "properties":

At the top of the hill within the park stands Brockwell Hall.\nWhilst competing against multiple demands from a broad range of other interests, the entirety of Brockwell Park is a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) of Borough Importance (Grade I), with mature trees including ancient oaks, substantial lawn areas set to meadow, and a series of lakes. As well as adding to the landscape value, these support a variety of birds, and bats including Pipistrelles, with frequent visits from rarer species like Daubentons, Noctule, Leisler's and Serotine bat.\nThe Park is listed for its heritage value on The National Heritage List for England, Parks & Gardens, Grade II. Noted for its nineteenth-century layout as a gracious public park, the clocktower, water garden, JJ Sexby-designed walled garden and other monuments, the park provides a pleasant exploration with links to its eighteenth-century agricultural past in the hedge lines, and mature oak trees. The model village houses outside the walled garden were originally donated to London County Council by Edgar Wilson in 1943.\nThe Brockwell Lido, a Grade II listed art deco building near the top of the park, is an open-air swimming pool popular with swimmers and bathers. Its attached caf\u00e9/restaurant is also popular.

For many years, the Savoy Theatre was the home of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, which continued to be run by the Carte family for over a century. Richard's son Rupert D'Oyly Carte rebuilt and modernised the theatre in 1929, and it was rebuilt again in 1993 following a fire. It is a Grade II* listed building.\nIn addition to The Mikado and other famous Gilbert and Sullivan premi\u00e8res, the theatre has hosted such premi\u00e8res as the first public performance in England of Oscar Wilde's Salome (1931) and No\u00ebl Coward's Blithe Spirit (1941).

It is situated on a sharp bend in the river, and links Battersea south of the river with Chelsea to the north. The bridge replaced a ferry service that had operated near the site since at least the middle of the 16th century.\nThe first Battersea Bridge was a toll bridge commissioned by John, Earl Spencer, who had recently acquired the rights to operate the ferry. Although a stone bridge was planned, difficulties in raising investment meant that a cheaper wooden bridge was built instead. Designed by Henry Holland, it was initially opened to pedestrians in November 1771, and to vehicle traffic in 1772. The bridge was inadequately designed and dangerous both to its users and to passing shipping, and boats often collided with it. To reduce the dangers to shipping, two piers were removed and the sections of the bridge above them were strengthened with iron girders.\nAlthough dangerous and unpopular, the bridge was the last surviving wooden bridge on the Thames in London, and was the subject of paintings by many significant artists such as J. M. W. Turner, John Sell Cotman and James McNeill Whistler, including Whistler's Nocturne: Blue and Gold\u00a0\u2013 Old Battersea Bridge, and his controversial Nocturne in Black and Gold\u00a0\u2013 The Falling Rocket.\nIn 1879 the bridge was taken into public ownership, and in 1885 demolished and replaced with the existing bridge, designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette and built by John Mowlem & Co. The narrowest surviving road bridge over the Thames in London, it is one of London's least busy Thames bridges. The location on a bend in the river makes the bridge a hazard to shipping, and it has been closed many times due to collisions.", "properties": [], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["district", "sightseeing", "poitype-Bridge", "district-battersea"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Bridge", "short_name": "bridge", "label": "poitype-Bridge", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.28649430119152, "poi_count": 230, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 7.9598005039128}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Bridge", "short_name": "bridge", "label": "poitype-Bridge", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.5355998088263, "poi_count": 2866, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 7.9598005039128}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Districts", "short_name": "Districts", "label": "district", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.98367334494397, "poi_count": 46744, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 7.9598005039128}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.95977622430187, "poi_count": 9866, "tour_count": 298, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "London is a huge city, so all individual listings are in the appropriate district articles and only an overview is presented here."}, "object_score": 7.9598005039128}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Battersea", "short_name": "Battersea", "label": "district-battersea", "location_id": "London", "score": 7.86603675824357, "poi_count": 517, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "Battersea is a district of South West London, England, within the London Borough of Wandsworth."}, "object_score": 7.9598005039128}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.97241702940085, "poi_count": 99860, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "From Land's End in the south to John O\u2019Groats in the north, there is so much to see in the United Kingdom."}, "object_score": 7.9598005039128}], "booking_info": null, "attribution": [{"source_id": "openstreetmap", "url": "http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23017704"}, {"source_id": "wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battersea%20Bridge"}], "price_tier": null, "opening_hours": null, "snippet": "In 1879 the bridge was taken into public ownership, and in 1885 demolished and replaced with the existing bridge, designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette and built by John Mowlem & Co.", "musement_venue_id": null, "location_id": "London", "location_ids": ["London", "United_Kingdom"], "popular": 0, "hours_spent": 1.0}, {"id": "N__812275475", "name": "Canada Memorial", "coordinates": {"latitude": 51.5029024, "longitude": -0.1426133}, "facebook_id": "1540608952879993", "score": 7.95726621092401, "intro": "The Canada Memorial in Green Park, London, United Kingdom, commemorates members of the Canadian Forces killed during the First and Second World Wars.

There have been two Chelsea Bridges, on the site of what was an ancient ford.\nThe first Chelsea Bridge was proposed in the 1840s as part of a major development of marshlands on the south bank of the Thames into the new Battersea Park. It was a suspension bridge intended to provide convenient access from the densely populated north bank to the new park. Although built and operated by the government, tolls were charged initially in an effort to recoup the cost of the bridge. Work on the nearby Chelsea Embankment delayed construction and so the bridge, initially called Victoria Bridge, did not open until 1858. Although well-received architecturally, as a toll bridge it was unpopular with the public, and Parliament felt obliged to make it toll-free on Sundays. The bridge was less of a commercial success than had been anticipated, partly because of competition from the newly built Albert Bridge nearby. It was acquired by the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1877, and the tolls were abolished in 1879.\nThe bridge was narrow and structurally unsound, leading the authorities to rename it Chelsea Bridge to avoid the Royal Family's association with a potential collapse. In 1926 it was proposed that the old bridge be rebuilt or replaced, due to the increased volume of users from population growth, and the introduction of the automobile. It was demolished during 1934\u20131937, and replaced by the current structure, which opened in 1937.\nThe new bridge was the first self-anchored suspension bridge in Britain, and was built entirely with materials sourced from within the British Empire. During the early 1950s it became popular with motorcyclists, who staged regular races across the bridge. One such meeting in 1970 erupted into violence, resulting in the death of one man and the imprisonment of 20 others. Chelsea Bridge is floodlit from below during the hours of darkness, when the towers and cables are illuminated by 936ft of light-emitting diodes. In 2008 it achieved Grade II listed status.

This distinctive cemetery has memorials ranging from large mausoleums housing the rich and famous to many distinctive smaller graves and includes special areas dedicated to the very young. It has three chapels, and serves all faiths. It is one of the Magnificent Seven cemeteries in London.\nThe cemetery was immortalised in the lines of G. K. Chesterton's poem \"The Rolling English Road\" from his book The Flying Inn: \"For there is good news yet to hear and fine things to be seen; Before we go to Paradise by way of Kensal Green.\"\nDespite its Grecian-style buildings the cemetery is primarily Gothic in character, due to the high number of private Gothic monuments.

Although he died a year later in the same house, his daughter Anna Freud continued to stay there until her death in 1982. It was her wish that after her death it be converted into a museum. It was opened to the public in July 1986.\nFreud continued to work in London and it was here that he completed his 1939 book Moses and Monotheism. He also maintained his practice in this home and saw a number of his patients for analysis. The centrepiece of the museum is the couch brought from Berggasse 19, Vienna on which his patients were asked to say whatever came to their mind without consciously selecting information, named the free association technique by him.\nThe museum was the subject of Part 2 of Richard Macer's 3 part BBC documentary series 'Behind the Scenes at the Museum' in 2010.\nThere are two other Freud Museums,

Handel was the first occupant of 25 Brook Street, which he rented from 1723 until his death there in 1759. Almost all his works after 1723, amongst them many of his best-known operas, oratorios and ceremonial music, were composed and partially rehearsed in the house, which contained a variety of keyboard instruments, including harpsichords, a clavichord and a small chamber organ.\nThe museum was opened in 2001 by the Handel House Trust as the result of an initiative of the musicologist and Handelian Stanley Sadie in 1959. It comprises a carefully restored set of period rooms on the first and second floors of 25 Brook Street together with exhibition rooms in number 23, the adjacent house on the terrace.

It was unveiled on 12 October 2006, the fourth anniversary of the bombings, by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, at a ceremony attended by relatives and friends of the 28 British victims.\nThe memorial commemorates the victims of all nationalities, with those from Britain listed apart at the centre of the inscription, which covers one side of a Portland stone wall. Standing near this wall is a granite globe with 202 doves carved across its surface. Martin Cook explained its symbolism thus: \"All of the 202 doves are unique, to represent each life lost and as symbols for peace. The globe shows how the victims came from all parts of the world and how indiscriminate terrorism is\".\nThe memorial is located at Clive Steps, near the King Charles Street entrance of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office building, and faces St. James's Park. A site near the Foreign Office was requested by the United Kingdom Bali Bombings Victims' Group, as a reminder to the British government of its failure to give adequate warning of the terrorist threat in Indonesia prior to the bombings. The government gave \u00a3100,000 towards the cost of the memorial.\nThe commission was facilitated by Memorials by Artists, part of the Lettering and Commemorative Arts Trust charity.", "properties": [{"key": "bus", "name": "Bus", "value": "11, 12, 159, 24, 3, 453, 87, 88, N109, N11, N136, N155, N3, N381, N44, N53, N87 (Westminster Station / Parliament Square);  (Parliament Square / Westminster Station); 148, 211 (Parliament Square / Westminster Abbey); 484 (Westminster Pier)", "ordinal": 1}, {"key": "subway", "name": "Subway", "value": "Circle, District, Jubilee (Westminster)", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "train", "name": "Train", "value": "Westminster", "ordinal": 3}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["district", "sightseeing", "poitype-Statue", "district-westminster"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Statue", "short_name": "statue", "label": "poitype-Statue", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.19216263330921, "poi_count": 3064, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 7.82939416235505}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Westminster", "short_name": "Westminster", "label": "district-westminster", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.81753858664938, "poi_count": 1038, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "Westminster is a city in its own right, the twin to the ancient City of London further east and historically they jointly formed the focus of what is today regarded as London."}, "object_score": 7.82939416235505}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Statue", "short_name": "statue", "label": "poitype-Statue", "location_id": "London", "score": 8.99953931790231, "poi_count": 425, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 7.82939416235505}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.95977622430187, "poi_count": 9866, "tour_count": 298, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "London is a huge city, so all individual listings are in the appropriate district articles and only an overview is presented here."}, "object_score": 7.82939416235505}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Districts", "short_name": "Districts", "label": "district", "location_id": "London", "score": 9.98367334494397, "poi_count": 46744, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 7.82939416235505}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "United_Kingdom", "score": 9.97241702940085, "poi_count": 99860, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "From Land's End in the south to John O\u2019Groats in the north, there is so much to see in the United Kingdom."}, "object_score": 7.82939416235505}], "booking_info": null, "attribution": [{"source_id": "openstreetmap", "url": "http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/345830787"}, {"source_id": "wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali%20Bombings%20Memorial%2C%20London"}], "price_tier": null, "opening_hours": null, "snippet": "James's Park.", "musement_venue_id": null, "location_id": "London", "location_ids": ["London", "United_Kingdom"], "popular": 0, "hours_spent": 1.0}, {"id": "N__696751534", "name": "Grant Museum of Zoology", "coordinates": {"latitude": 51.523747, "longitude": -0.1342703}, "facebook_id": "518950638201808", "score": 7.82284296290171, "intro": "The Grant Museum of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy is a natural history museum that is part of University College London in London, England.

Originally, only half the site was given over for burials while the other half was maintained as a nursery before it was converted in the 1930s and the whole site was renamed East Sheen Cemetery. It is today contiguous with Richmond Cemetery, though the original boundary is marked by a hedge. The cemetery's chapel is used for services by both sites, as Richmond Cemetery's chapel is no longer in use as such. The chapel was built in 1906 in the Gothic revival style by local architect Reginald Rowell, who was himself later buried in the cemetery.\nMany prominent people are buried in the cemetery, which contains several significant memorials. The most important monument in the cemetery is the memorial to George William Lancaster and his wife by Sydney March\u2014a bronze sculpture of an angel weeping over a stone sarcophagus dating from the 1920s, which is considered to be one of the most important sculptures of its type from the 20th century. Also significant are the memorial to Markham Buxton, a bronze relief on a stone stele by his son Alfred; a miniature walled garden commemorating Edouard Espinosa and his wife Eve Louise Kelland; and several other sculptures, both Christian-themed and secular.
