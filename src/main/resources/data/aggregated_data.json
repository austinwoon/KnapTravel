Well organized and management has done a wonderful job with the queues and visual direction arrows. We somehow managed to push ourselves to cover this place at the very last.\nAll the 3 shows are good, the best part is, it's open till 10 pm, so after wings of time, this can be covered. I personally liked the log ride, that was adventurous and fun, the sudden movements that you get are pretty exhilarating. Overall worth the money spent and highly recommended@",

When we rented the bicycles last week, we had low expectations, but were pleasantly delighted to see all new bikes. The bicycles were either new or very well maintained, my friends and I had no issues with the bicycles we chose for our 2 hour ride.\nThe Chinese lady who attended to us was super courteous and accommodating! Kudos to her service, though I forgot her name.\nWill come back to try their Segway rides, since Segway is now discontinued, I think there aren't many chances to ride a Segway anymore!\nAlso, Ola Beach Club right behind Gogreen is a great place to cool down after the ride!",

But unfortunately when it comes to the visuals and sound of the actual VR headset, there's nothing to write home about. For me it takes me out of the experience and I don't feel it truly shows what VR is truly capable of. With the amount that you are spending, I rather you take your money else where. There are a bunch of other VR experiences in singapore that does better with the price you are paying. The best thing i had done there was the archery and it wasn't even part of the VR experience, they were generous with the arrows and the time you can spend in there. And I personally am a huge VR fan. If you come to sentosa solely for HeadRock VR, you might be disappointed. Out of all the VR experiences there, I would have to say that Beat saber would be the best amongst the others.",

After the game, we asked if the girl in charge of that zone can help us with a quick group photograph on the ride. There were 4 of us on that ride, $13 X 4 customers. And she just replied she saw someone else taking video already and ask us to get video from that person, to brush off the request. There was no queue and no one else after us. That girl clearly prefers to stand there staring into space instead of helping us. It is for memory sake, we may not take this exact same ride anytime soon and with the same group of people. I wonder is this the standard of entertainment attractions that Resorts World Sentosa and Headrock VR are providing for patrons. It is very disappointing and dampens our mood.",

This is a place where we would definitely recommend to go to. In fact, the history to this location is more than just a building as there is an in depth background of how this building came about back in the early days of Singapore.\n\nOn top of its rich background location, having this Escape Room with historical/folklore stories gives this location a 2 in 1 effect, especially in knowledge and fun. Not the 1st time here, and will guarantee that it will not be the last time here either.. We used to frequent here for other reasons before the building was used for a different purpose \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01.\n\nNway, we were here with our friends trying out various challenges available. With those challenges, one challenge stood out more compared to the rest. 'Radin Mas' name came out more than the rest. It may be because of the history and stories that we grew up with.. Or maybe even because the challenge was very much interesting compared to the others.\n\nAll in all, we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. Recommended to many others! Cheers!!",

Even kids can play I think... I was sweating all over and a bit difficult to breathe with the masks on.\n\nI like the ranking part also.

It's more like an immersive computer game that you play with your whole body, rather than just a keyboard and mouse.

You can see the whole Sentosa Island from the Top, especially Universal Studios (one of the attractions of Sentosa Island). I just love the ride. It is of around 5-7 minutes ride but it's amazing.

When we reached there at 2pm, the place was full due to covid and the next available session was at 4pm. The waiting area was filled with people to the max. There wasn't even a vending machine that you can buy drinks. The chairs also looked like it needed cleaning. When it was 4pm, it was also not our turn yet because there were still people from the 3pm list. We went in only like 4.30pm and didn't really finished the 2 hour because it closes at 6. The jacket and shoes seems dirty. The gloves were also torned. The wait for the bumper car was long. The only thing that was fun was the slide.\n\nIt understandable to limit people in the place but there should be better management such as allowing pre booking of timeslot so that people don't have to wait so long or arriving with a online ticket to find out the place was full and there is no next session. The staff outside isn't very friendly or helpful either.\n\nNot worth the time and money to go there.",

Price was on the high side which I felt not justifiable albeit the many stations there. Facilities were all clean and well maintained. Staffs were friendly and polite too even though they are there explaining to the customers the whole day. Will be nice if there\u2019s water cooler stations and if the price of the socks can be cheaper. Free locker provided too which was good.",

            "text": "Awesome place. Many things to do from Rock climbing to Racing. There are 2 levels. Most of the children's activities are on the top level. The Entrance, ticket counter and lockers are also found here. The bottom level has more adult-based games and activities such as a Rock climbing and a ninja course.\nHowever, these activities are also suitable for children(if they are more than 100cm tall) The park has many safety features and staff are well trained to handle any situation at specific activity locations. Tip: If you're thinking of going to the mega playground from the top floor, don't use the stairs. Go around the corner and walk and you will get to an entrance and if you climb down, you will end up in the playground saving you a minute. I highly recommend this indoor playground as it is really fun!",

If you want to not only enjoy the rides but watch the shows also be sure to start early so you can enjoy both. For children they have Sesame Street live show and Shrek in 3D. Adults will love the live Water World show. Its my favorite. Be prepared to get wet though. The Mummy ride and the Transformers are not one for the fainthearted so beware.

Not your typical lock and key only, but very interactive puzzles. Not very hard to solve but still need some thinking to get pass them.\n\nLocation is very nicely decorated to fit the theme. Spacious and clean.\n\nThe staffs are all very friendly and helpful.

This is a place where we would definitely recommend to go to. In fact, the history to this location is more than just a building as there is an in depth background of how this building came about back in the early days of Singapore.\n\nOn top of its rich background location, having this Escape Room with historical/folklore stories gives this location a 2 in 1 effect, especially in knowledge and fun. Not the 1st time here, and will guarantee that it will not be the last time here either.. We used to frequent here for other reasons before the building was used for a different purpose \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01.\n\nNway, we were here with our friends trying out various challenges available. With those challenges, one challenge stood out more compared to the rest. 'Radin Mas' name came out more than the rest. It may be because of the history and stories that we grew up with.. Or maybe even because the challenge was very much interesting compared to the others.\n\nAll in all, we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. Recommended to many others! Cheers!!",

This time however, throughout the entire 1 hr there wasn\u2019t even one bite on both mine and my friend\u2019s line. Everytime we check, the bait is full, no change. Even when I didn\u2019t catch any prawns last time, the bait will at least be eaten without us realising but this time there just wasn\u2019t any prawn biting.\n\nAbout 8.30pm, staff added some prawns. Still no bite. Then realised the people across us were using their own bait and catching lots. People around us who didn\u2019t have their own bait were also not catching anything at all, not even so much of a bite.\n\nReal waste of $20, ORTO should consider seperating people who brought their own bait from those who didn\u2019t. Otherwise, they might as well just give all the prawns to the people who brought their own baits instead of releasing into the pond.",

It's a nice end of day activity before wrapping it up and getting some good night rest.\n\nThe VIP seats located in the centre back, but I think the normal seat as long as you're in the centre area is good enough. Plenty of space on weekdays but not sure on weekends. Getting here is easy using the Sentosa Monorail, stop at the end of the line; Beach Station.",

We had to make a booking to meet the quota, so there is control in the number of children that are allowed to play there.\nThe moment we went in ,  we were greeted by staff, and had our hands sanitized and we checked into the place.\nThere were shoe racks for the kids to put their shoes away.My Daughter had loads of fun, there was ball pit, and a wood pebbles to play some scoop and pour activities, there was a supermarket play area to scan and buy vegetables and fruits, which is very good for play pretend.\nThere was even a train ride !! That was a highlight of the 2 hours playtime where my girl rang the conductor bell!! She meet one of Pororo main mascot and was happy that she is able to say hi and take many pictures as well\nWe had an awesome time there, where she played with her friend and cousin. Highly recommend going there with your kids! Its well sanitized and kept very clean and tidy.",

I did not see any bouncy castle. There was no show. All the battery operated toys I came across would not work - because there were no batteries installed inside. Some of the toys were partly broken, for eg., the bed of the dump trucks had come off and could not be fixed. Extra coins to be paid for the coin-operated ride inside. I found hair and other foreign particles in the hinoki wood pit area. On the positive side, friendly staff for train rides.",

If you want to not only enjoy the rides but watch the shows also be sure to start early so you can enjoy both. For children they have Sesame Street live show and Shrek in 3D. Adults will love the live Water World show. Its my favorite. Be prepared to get wet though. The Mummy ride and the Transformers are not one for the fainthearted so beware.

Let me bring you to the old Esplanade it was name Queen Elizabeth walk nothing much to see. As you walk from across the Bridge from the G.P.O. (Fullerton Five Star Hotel now) you can see from afar a big U shape. A place for eating. There was a Stay Club at the end, Noddle Stall, other Food Stalls and also drink Stall. They have Square shining tables and chairs very light to carry. We all have our dinner under the stars. We can see the ships far from our shore. There were many small bum boats near Clifford Pier. After our meal we took a slow walk at Queen Elizabeth walk again and than we go home.",

            "text": "The prayer hall is raised above the ground and surrounded with verandahs at the entrance and sides. It is oriented towards Mecca and thus skewed away from the lot lines and the street.\nThe verandahs are enclosed by a balustrade with circular and lancet-shaped openings and framed by repetitive cinquefoil arches double-framed with heavy mouldings. The bays are marked out with pilasters with ornate capitals. The wide openings give the interior an airiness that contrasts with the heavy columns in the centre of the prayer hall.\nOn either side of the main entrance are two graduated cinquefoil arched openings. The larger ones are nearest the entrance, while the smaller ones are further away.\nThe main entrance to the prayer hall is pedimented with an elaborate sundial in which the 25 rays of the sunburst are done in calligraphy. The sundial is flanked on either side by a series of pilasters and columns in miniature. The pediment above the sundial is shaped like an onion dome. The two square minarets on the left and right are complete with miniature columns and arches.\nThere are panels with calligraphic inscriptions in several places in the mosque, including over the entrance.\nThe interior of the cupola at the centre of the prayer hall is supported by four large cluster columns that form semicircular arches. Square and round calligraphic inscriptions decorate the interior of the cupola.\nThe cluster columns that hold up the cupola have elaborate mouldings and capitals.\nFrom the exterior, the cupola emerges from the roof deck as a hexagonal-shaped tower that is divided into three levels and marked out with Doric pilasters.\nOn the first level of the tower are eight cinquefoil windows with coloured glass panes that let light through to the interior. These windows are ornamented with recessed mihrab-shaped moulding and cinquefoil arches.\nThe second level has pilasters and capitals and is topped by a balustrade with bottleneck balusters.\nThere are minarets at the corners of the hexagon. These minarets are crowned with onion-shaped domes with a crescent moon and a star at the pinnacle. The very centre of the hexagon is crowned with a large onion dome topped with a smaller onion dome. On the pinnacle is a star and crescent moon.\nThe corners of the front verandah have simpler and less elaborate cupolas.\nThe four corners of the building are anchored by large Corinthian columns in a cluster with elaborate capitals in a leaf design. The interior and exterior of the mosque have several types of columns and pilasters. They are both structural and ornamental and range from Doric to Corinthian. Columns can be paired with pilasters and pilasters are inset into columns.\nThe mihrab is plain. There is a narrow rectangular panel with a quotation from the Qur'an above it. Next to the mihrab is the minbar, a three-step timber staircase from which the imam leads prayers.\nAbove the prayer hall is a flat roof deck surrounded by a parapet wall with bottle-shaped balusters. It is topped with a line of 22 small six-level minarets crowned with onion domes, each with a crescent moon. The miniature minarets rise from the pilasters that frame the cinquefoil arched openings below\nThere is also a type of single-leafed window that is recessed and framed by an elaborate cinquefoil arch. It is flanked with pilasters and pedimented and has the same star-and-crescent pattern of the larger arched openings.\nThe ablution area in this mosque was originally a pool. This was later drained and a modern wash area put in. It is located outside at the southwest end of the mosque.",

Remember to check out the pricing online and buy the tickets online first before coming over to collect it. It will be faster this way. One of the dome has the world's tallest indoor waterfall and the place is beautiful. The other dome has various plants at different season.\n\nRemember to check out the maintenance of the indoor waterfall for the day of your visit. I went once and it was closed.\n\nThere are other places to look around outside of the domes but usually it's too hot during the day.\n\nThere are light and music show at the supertree groves at 8pm and other timings. There are also food places nearby the supertree groves to dine at.\n\nYou can go back towards the city with a link bridge towards Marina Bay Sands (the ship like hotel).\n\nEnjoy your day here !",

Not much interactive activities, but it is after all a museum of wax statues. The few activities they do have were hit-and-misses for me. The Singapore boat ride was quite short and could have been better if it was more educational instead of a mish-mash of Singapore-related things and people. The Marvel 4D show was entertaining, and the VR race was quite a fun experience though. Tried the Ultimate Film Star experience too and I guess it would be fun if there with a group of people to do the various stations together, and if you're into Bollywood. Overall, a pleasant trip but not someplace I would really want to visit again.",

The approach via can was not direct as I was dropped off about 100m away from the main entrance, but it was a good walk after a long cab ride!\n\nI booked my ticket through \"Tiquet\" app and got S$2 discount on each ticket at S$6! The outside was maintained well and place was tidy and clean. The ticket redemption counter was fairly easy to navigate and the staff were pleasant and helpful.\n\nThere were 3 levels and each level was filled with different aspects of cultural artefacts and ancient items from different centuries. \"The Tang Shipwreck\" was a standout for me and loved how the entire area was set up, so KUDOS to the Curators!!\n\nIt was a long walk across all 3 levels, so do bring comfortable shoes. We were able to cover all three levels and was impressed with everything I saw. I wonder what is the significance of the \"Directors Pick\" was - noticed several items with a red banner against a number of the artefacts.",

It was built around 1937 by the Har Par brothers who made their fortune manufacturing Tiger Balm medicinal products. The park has some eerie and somewhat gaudy statues and dioraramas depicting chinese characters from folklore and mythology. I must say that these oriental statues and figurines are not in my opinion a work of art but has to be appreciated as part of Singapore's cultural heritage. Fifty years ago this park served as a means for families to bring their children here to teach the ancient Chinese folklore history. Sadly, the theme park is in need of repairs. It is still an attraction for families to visit but the dioramas and statues really does not blend in with modern Singapore. Hong Kong's Tiger Balm gardens were razed twenty something years ago and new apartment structure stands in its place. It is only a matter of time that realty development will take over this space. It is still a fascinating place to visit and the best is that it has no admission charge.",

    "body": "<p>Singapore Food Makes Me Hungry is penned by two of Artsence@SouthBridge\u2019s founders Jennifer Lim (Jenn) and Geraldine Koh (Geri) with the latter also the book\u2019s illustrator. Both Jenn and Geri are very familiar and enamoured with Singapore\u2019s local food scene having been raised and lived in Singapore for most of their lives. The book is a celebration of Singapore\u2019s ubiquitous hawker culture, containing illustrations and detailed descriptions of many unique local dishes. Many of these dishes can traced back to each of Singapore\u2019s major racial groups which have many popular dishes sold in hawker centres across the island.</p><p>The front cover conveys a design meant to evoke memories of ordering takeaway from a \u2018zi char\u2019 stall. \u2018Zi char\u2019 is a Hokkien phrase describing stalls which sell Chinese dishes meant for sharing and customers can choose from at least twenty different dishes of vegetables, meat, seafood, rice and noodles. The food may be consumed on site or if customers choose to eat it elsewhere, it is usually packed into a thin white paper box. The phrase \u2018jio le\u2019 can be found on the front cover and it is a Teochew phrase meaning to invite people and reflects Artsence@SouthBridge inviting readers to go on a gastronomical journey as they flip through the book.</p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">The back of the book contains more than just the standard paragraphs about the authors because readers will find pieces of paper containing printed sketches of the dishes featured in the book. These sketches are not coloured to allow readers to paint the them using colour pencils. How they paint them is of course left to the preference of the readers.</span><br></p>",

    "body": "<p>The museum is a haven for treasures of this remarkable culture, and a tour of the Intan gives visitors a chance to walk back in time and marvel at the spirit of the Peranakan people. On arrival at the museum, the first thing that strikes you is how unassuming the exteriors of the house are. It is not until you walk inside that you get to marvel at the astounding collection of antiques that attempts to combine the charm of the past within the contemporary setting.\nThe open layout and the mirrors create the aura of a spacious indoors, and within it, the sheer diversity of collectables from years gone by. From rows of beaded traditional slippers with intricate designs to vibrantly closured costumes, jewelry pieces and an array of trinkets, there is no shortage of traditional aspects to learn about in this culture.\n\nIt is fascinating to note that, unlike your typical museum where information cards abound, The Intan has no cards at all. Ask Alvin Yapp, the museum\u2019s owner, anything about the different collections and he will gladly indulge you.\n\nA tour of this museum is incomplete without enjoying a meal the Peranakan way. Needless to say, this is a favorite for many visitors as it is an opportune moment to sample traditional snacks and meals dotingly prepared by Mr Yapp\u2019s mother. Best of all, the meals are served in charming crockery for a holistic Peranakan experience. Depending on the time of your visit, you may listen in to Yapp and a few of his family members belt out a local song or two.\n\nThe Intan is open by appointment only, so bookings must be made in advance to ensure slots are available. Custom made packages are also available for private events as long as they are related to the Peranakan culture. Visitors should note that visits are strictly by appointment only.</p><p><br></p><p>*** This experience is only available if COVID 19 regulations allow</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

True to their practice of elaborating on Chinese custom, the complete Baba wedding ceremony was extended over a period of 12 days.  \u201cSeronee \u201c music was played with a flute and gong throughout the ceremony. The wedding procession comprised of a pair lanterns with the surnames of the wedding couple, red buntings ( \u201cchye-kee\u201d) propped on bamboo poles, signifying good luck and prosperity and a pair of brocade umbrellas , to shelter the couple. The bride wore heavily embroidered layers of costumes, with a crown of  floral hairpins  and  a headband. She was the \u201cempress\u201d of the day and walked, swaying in a gentle left to right motion \u2013 a belief that this movement would ward off any clashes with evil spirits. The groom , too , wore several layers of embroidered  costumes,  his jewels were confined to a jewelled cap, collar and belt. The bridal couple were assisted by a \u201cSanh-ke-um\u201d ( Mistress-of-ceremony) and a \u201cPakchindek\u201d (groom\u2019s assistant).

            "text": "My mom and sister went to the Canopy park yesterday.\n\nWhile the attractions were big fun, they encountered issues with unfriendly and doubtful staffs at the Sky Net, resulted in really unpleasant experiences.\n\nMy mom and sister did not enter Sky Net until 3:30pm, but the staffs said they have already been to the attraction at 3pm. While there is apparently system error where the blame should be on the dev team, the staffs pointed the arrow at my parent. With complete false confidence, they said their system will not have any mistake, and accused my mom for lying, saying she definitely has been there at 3pm. The staff also repeatedly asked my 8 years old sister if she has been to the attraction, giving absolutely 0 respect and trust in my mom's words. My mom is a kind woman and my sister is still small so they really couldn't talk back, had a really tough time handling the rain of accusations from the attraction staffs.\n\nWhat is there to scam for? An entry? System failure is to blame the consumer? Is that the way Canopy Park and holder group operate? Where are the core values?\n\nI urge you to not go to Sky Net if you want to avoid awful experience. Everywhere was fine but just don't go to Sky Net.",

There's a bar and shop on the ground floor. I particularly loved the \"Outer Space\" collection on floor 5, with toys themed to familiar science-fiction media and space exploration. (There I found the one item in the collection that I personally owned: a kids' card game from the late 60s called \"Space Race.\") There are some labels describing the history and provenance of some of the toys, including proud indications of particularly rare and valuable ones. For anyone whose childhood was somewhere from about 1920-1985, this place will hold a powerful kick of nostalgia.",

It was followed by a sumptuous spread of all our favourite Peranakan kueh ranging from Kueh Pie Tee to the feast of colours you see in the picture. He was very kind to help us with a surprise birthday celebration too. We were beaming from both the wonderful catch-up we had in such a lovely ambience and the authentic dishes. Will highly recommend the concept to all family, friends and tourists who are looking for a nostalgic trip down Peranakan history paired with impeccable hospitality. \u2764\ufe0f",

    "body": "<p>The history of Gillman Barracks is tied \nto the island\u2019s colonial past. It was built\n in 1936 for the British 1st Battalion and\n was named after General Sir Webb\n Gillman. During World War II, it was\n one of the final battle sites before\n Singapore fell into the hands of the \nJapanese troops. After the country\u2019s \nindependence in 1965, the site became\n prime training ground for Singapore\u2019s\n national servicemen. Only in 2012 was \nthe area transformed into an enclave \nof contemporary art. Visitors will find\n international galleries such as Mizuma\nGallery (www.mizuma.sg) and Sullivan\n+ Strumpf (www.sullivanstrumpf.com)\n alongside homegrown outfits like FOST\nGallery (www.fostgallery.com) and Chan\n+ Hori Contemporary (www.chanhori.\ncom). There are also several dining \noptions like Masons (www.masons.sg)\n for European cuisine and The Naked&nbsp;Finn (www.nakedfinn.com) for top\n quality seafood dishes. Galleries open \npast their usual hours during the Art\n After Dark event (www.gillmanbarracks.\ncom/others/gillman-barracks/current),\n which features live music and pop-up\nfood stalls.</p>",

The event has many names and is also called Mooncake, Harvest or Lantern festival and is nowadays rather similar to Thanksgiving.\nHistorically the festival dates back to the Chinese Shang Dynasty (1600-1046 BC) where it was a Harvest festival. In years to come some Epic stories brought in a twist and the Moon goddess Chang'e brought the full moon to the center of the festival. The yellowish, round shaped Mooncakes are an important part of the family gathering during this period.",

Get inspired by the massive Dacron canvas sails, tall wooden masts and luxurious handcrafted woodwork on board the ship which took craftsman over 360,00 man-hours and over 6 years to redesign. \n\nThe Royal Albatross was designed by Hollywood Master Rigger, Jim Barry who was involved in the designing of the ships in Master &amp; Commander and Pirates of the Caribbean and had even appeared in the movie \u201cDark Knight\u201d as Bruce Wayne\u2019s private yacht. This famous ship played host to international guests like Princess Anne, Actress Jane Seymour, and many others.\n\nIndulge yourself from the time you board with a specially crafted welcome drink. Make memories on board the ship and enjoy the company of your loved ones as we set sail with a specially curated 3-course menu. Choose to venture on 2 very unique sailing experiences by sailing into the Sunset or watching as Singapore\u2019s Cityscape light up at night with fireworks en-route. Experience something unique onboard the Royal Albatross. \n\n\n<br><br><b>American Origins<br></b><br>\nThe Royal Albatross started her life in Charleston, South Carolina, the USA in 2001 as Windy II. Used for day trips and cruises along Lake Michigan and the Great Lakes. She participated in regional tall ship festivals and races along the summer months. She was acquired in 2008 and relocated Singapore from Chicago 15,000Km away. The Royal Albatross is currently the only Tall Ship in Asia. \n\nWhat the name stands for\nThe Albatross family has 22 species of birds which represents each one of the 22 sails onboard the ship. The largest most elegant species of the Albatross family is the Royal Albatross. And similar to the Royal Albatross the ship in all its brilliance can cover great distances at sea elegantly and effortlessly.\n<br><br><br><b>Traditional Uses</b> <br><br>\nTall ships were used as the only form of global transport in the Golden age of Discovery, Ships like these could cover massive distances across the oceans and were usually in charge of carrying precious cargo for international trade. In fact, a similar tall ship the Santa Maria famously transported Christopher Columbus from Spain to discover America in 1492. &nbsp;\n\nOver time thousands of these ships were lost at sea, leaving today; less than 100 working tall ships in existence, most of them owned by Navy\u2019s, Trusts and NPO\u2019s. A few are in private ownership and certified for passenger service for the public to use.&nbsp; Of these few, the Royal Albatross the only one reconfigured to a luxury specification, making her the most unique luxury Tall Ship in the world!\n\n<br><br>Sticking to tradition, the Royal Albatross is a traditionally rigged Barquentine Class A Tall Ship with 22 sails, 4 masts, and over 200 ropes.&nbsp; She requires a specialized crew to maintain her and manually operate the various sails on board the which add to the ship's unique appeal.<br></p>",

At first I thought she didn't hear me so repeated twice then she took out her earphone and say \"what you want?\" with an attitude tone and give me a black face like it was my fault to ask nicely.\n\n2) As I was already ordering my drinks with another staff, half way she just say \"we closing in 30mins\" in yet another rude tone. Why didn't they inform me when I first come in? And wait till I settle down and order half way then inform me about it?\n\nI really don't understand why must both staff be so rude and give an attitude tone? When I was just asking nicely and also ordering normally.\n\nSo far I got no issue with any coffee stall place I went to for my entire life.

            "text": "Interested in whisky, and have quite in-depth study about the category, I was excited to see there is a whisky collection in Singapore! The signs to the museum was very clear, though I had doubts at first, because it was leading towards the carpark. It is parked away in a corner of the carpark on the level 5 of Ion Orchard, with a very elegant sign on the way.\n\nThere was a counter at the entrance, with two indian staff chit-chatting behind the counter. I approached them, wanting to find out more about the place. Firstly, they were very caught them in their own jokes, and then when the male staff noticed me, he said something inaudible and made some incomprehensible gestures with a fierce face. Before I could even finish my sentence to ask more about this place, he said something else (most likely English but it is incomprehensible) in a very rude tone.\n\nThere was no intention to share with me what this collection is about, how I can get tickets, what I can get out of here. I did some research online afterwards, and to be honest the place is quite impressive. However, the image is totally destroyed by the staff, who cannot converse in English, unwelcoming, and disinterested in customer service. Without this part been fixed, I will definitely go out of my way to discourage my whisky friends to visit this place.",

Visitors will have the unique experience of being able to walk into the boardroom where the surrender took place on 15 February 1942. Learn about acts of atrocity such as \u2018Sook Ching\u2019 where there was mass screening of Chinese men and those suspected of being anti-Japanese were mercilessly killed. Discover other harrowing experiences and the different ways people responded to severe challenges and suffering through the display of personal items from that time and the oral history interviews of eye witnesses to actual events. Join the walk in tours led by experienced volunteer guides to discover more stories behind the rich collections on display. There are 20 places available daily (except for public holidays). Tour schedules are subject to change, so to avoid disappointment, do check the website for details.<br></p>",

    "body": "<p>The museum is a haven for treasures of this remarkable culture, and a tour of the Intan gives visitors a chance to walk back in time and marvel at the spirit of the Peranakan people. On arrival at the museum, the first thing that strikes you is how unassuming the exteriors of the house are. It is not until you walk inside that you get to marvel at the astounding collection of antiques that attempts to combine the charm of the past within the contemporary setting. The open layout and the mirrors create the aura of a spacious indoors, and within it, the sheer diversity of collectables from years gone by. From rows of beaded traditional slippers with intricate designs to vibrantly coloured costumes, jewellery pieces and an array of trinkets, there is no shortage of traditional aspects to learn about in this culture. It is fascinating to note that, unlike your typical museum where information cards abound, The Intan has no cards at all. Ask Alvin Yapp, the museum\u2019s owner, anything about the different collections and he will gladly indulge you. A tour of this museum is incomplete without enjoying tea&nbsp; the Peranakan way. Needless to say, this is a favorite for many visitors as it is an opportune moment to sample traditional snacks&nbsp; dotingly prepared by one of Yapp's aunts. Best of all, the refreshments are served in charming crockery for a holistic Peranakan experience. Depending on the time of your visit, you may listen in to Yapp and a few of his family members belt out a local song or two. The Intan is open by appointment only, so bookings must be made in advance to ensure slots are available. Custom made packages are also available for private events as long as they are related to the Peranakan culture. Visitors should note that visits are strictly by appointment only.</p><p><br></p><p>Your experience at The Intan is approximately 1 hour and it includes:</p><p>- Tea &amp; home-made Peranakan refreshments (available if COVID 19 regulations allow)</p><p>- A brief understanding of the history and culture of the Peranakans</p><p>- Learning about the traditional and lavish Peranakan wedding ceremony</p><p>- Appreciating the colorful and intricate beadwork &amp; embroidery handmade by the Nyonya ladies Peranakan women<br></p><p><br></p>",

    "body": "<p>The museum is a haven for treasures of this remarkable culture, and a tour of the Intan gives visitors a chance to walk back in time and marvel at the spirit of the Peranakan people. On arrival at the museum, the first thing that strikes you is how unassuming the exteriors of the house are. It is not until you walk inside that you get to marvel at the astounding collection of antiques that attempts to combine the charm of the past within the contemporary setting.\nThe open layout and the mirrors create the aura of a spacious indoors, and within it, the sheer diversity of collectables from years gone by. From rows of beaded traditional slippers with intricate designs to vibrantly coloured costumes, jewellery pieces and an array of trinkets, there is no shortage of traditional aspects to learn about in this culture.\n\nIt is fascinating to note that, unlike your typical museum where information cards abound, The Intan has no cards at all. Ask Alvin Yapp, the museum\u2019s owner, anything about the different collections and he will gladly indulge you.\n\nA tour of this museum is incomplete without enjoying tea&nbsp; the Peranakan way. Needless to say, this is a favorite for many visitors as it is an opportune moment to sample traditional snacks&nbsp; dotingly prepared by one of Yapp's aunts. Best of all, the refreshments are served in charming crockery for a holistic Peranakan experience. Depending on the time of your visit, you may listen in to Yapp and a few of his family members belt out a local song or two.\n\nThe Intan is open by appointment only, so bookings must be made in advance to ensure slots are available. Custom made packages are also available for private events as long as they are related to the Peranakan culture. Visitors should note that visits are strictly by appointment only.</p><p>Your experience at The Intan is approximately 1 hour and it includes:\n</p><p>\n- Tea &amp; home-made Peranakan refreshments (only if COVID 19 regulations allow)</p><p>- A brief understanding of the history and culture of the Peranakans\n\n</p><p>- Learning about the traditional and lavish Peranakan wedding ceremony\n</p><p>\n- Appreciating the colorful and intricate beadwork &amp; embroidery handmade by the Nyonya ladies Peranakan women<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

The lack of adequate sanitation access to more than half of the global population and the staggering number of deaths caused by water and sanitation-related diarrheal diseases highlight the detrimental impact of poor sanitation, especially among developing countries. Just as water is key to survival, toilets are critical to help prevent spread of diseases. That is why the United Nations General Assembly introduced Sustainable Development Goal 6, which promises sanitation for all by 2030 by calling for universal access to adequate and equitable sanitation and an end to open defecation.\n</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">At this exhibition, guests may explore the five themed zones featuring over 15 interactive exhibits \u2013\n</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><b>ZONE 1: TO FLUSH OR NOT TO FLUSH\n</b></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">Have you ever flushed your pet fish down the toilet bowl? Or a cockroach? You may not be the only one! However, these are things that should not go down the loo. Challenge yourself to identify things that you should or should not flush down the toilet bowl.\n</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><b>ZONE 2: BIOLOGY OF WASTES\n</b></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">Go back to basics with a lesson on digestion and waste production. From bowel transit time to pathogen transmissions, here is everything you need to know about what goes on inside your digestive system. Plus, journey through the Secret Chamber of Farts to learn fun facts on bodily gas! Not to be missed!\n</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><b>ZONE 3: WHERE DO WASTES GO?\n</b></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">Now that you\u2019ve made an offering to the porcelain throne, what happens next? Zone 3 illustrates the \u201coffloading\u201d process and how wastes are collected around different parts of the world. Get the dirt on the engineering behind our toilet bowls, then sober up with a showcase on the global sanitation crisis and the need for improved sanitation in less-developed countries.\n</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><b>ZONE 4: SINGAPORE WASTE TREATMENT STORY\n</b></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">Society has come a long way from open defecation to the modern flush toilets installed in almost every home. Explore how toilets and sanitation have evolved over the course of Singapore\u2019s history by taking a peek into cubicles showcasing past and present conditions. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><b> \nZONE 5: KEEP YOUR TOILETS CLEAN </b></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">\nChallenge yourself to clean the toilet in the fastest time and be crowned as the King of Toilet.

It is free btw.\n\nBasically this nature discovery is a exhibition area and a broad walk walk through the nature reserves in sentosa which was once the old monorail track.\n\nThe main center itself is very informative. Telling you about the nature in sentosa (natural reefs, primary and secondary forest etc). There is also a downstairs section where it talks about the type of rocks found in sentosa. This place is a real gem.\n\nThe trail itself is good too. It is a nature walk to the imbiah trail where one can get some fresh air. Think of it like walking through bukit timah!

While there is apparently system error where the blame should be on the dev team, the staffs pointed the arrow at my parent. With complete false confidence, they said their system will not have any mistake, and accused my mom for lying, saying she definitely has been there at 3pm. The staff also repeatedly asked my 8 years old sister if she has been to the attraction, giving absolutely 0 respect and trust in my mom's words. My mom is a kind woman and my sister is still small so they really couldn't talk back, had a really tough time handling the rain of accusations from the attraction staffs.\n\nWhat is there to scam for? An entry? System failure is to blame the consumer? Is that the way Canopy Park and holder group operate? Where are the core values?\n\nI urge you to not go to Sky Net if you want to avoid awful experience. Everywhere was fine but just don't go to Sky Net.",

            "text": "My mom and sister went to the Canopy park yesterday.\n\nWhile the attractions were big fun, they encountered issues with unfriendly and doubtful staffs at the Sky Net, resulted in really unpleasant experiences.\n\nMy mom and sister did not enter Sky Net until 3:30pm, but the staffs said they have already been to the attraction at 3pm. While there is apparently system error where the blame should be on the dev team, the staffs pointed the arrow at my parent. With complete false confidence, they said their system will not have any mistake, and accused my mom for lying, saying she definitely has been there at 3pm. The staff also repeatedly asked my 8 years old sister if she has been to the attraction, giving absolutely 0 respect and trust in my mom's words. My mom is a kind woman and my sister is still small so they really couldn't talk back, had a really tough time handling the rain of accusations from the attraction staffs.\n\nWhat is there to scam for? An entry? System failure is to blame the consumer? Is that the way Canopy Park and holder group operate? Where are the core values?\n\nI urge you to not go to Sky Net if you want to avoid awful experience. Everywhere was fine but just don't go to Sky Net.",

Spread across three themed zones, the exhibition showcases the current state of cities and urges everyone to question their urban practices, whilst exploring the stories of a few selected cities modelled around sustainability, greening, diversity and smart technologies \u2013\n</p><p><b>CITIES UNDER PRESSURE</b>\n</p><p>In this zone, the complexity of the \u201ccity\u201d system is dissected into basic components to reveal its hidden workings, and the tensions that can arise. Here, guests can examine and reflect upon their experience. \n</p><p><b>URBAN EARTH</b>\n</p><p>Through dynamic representa\u00actions of maps and global data, cities around the world are visualised together in a multi-media spectacle. This gives us a planet-wide appreciation of cities from the angle of their differences or similarities too. How does your city compare against other cities globally?\n</p><p><b>URBAN FUTURES</b>\n</p><p>Explore an array of urban solutions selected for their originality, specificity or exemplary character. Be amazed by initiatives and innovations undertaken by various cities and their citizens to address the urban challenges that they face.<br></p>",

The other dome has various plants at different season.\n\nRemember to check out the maintenance of the indoor waterfall for the day of your visit. I went once and it was closed.\n\nThere are other places to look around outside of the domes but usually it's too hot during the day.\n\nThere are light and music show at the supertree groves at 8pm and other timings.

The restaurants at the top are extremely expensive however and if you ever get the chance to afford it, do get the tables hanging outside - it is an amazing view (from what I saw standing at the entrance) these are just some views I managed to take from the top of marina bay sands. The convention center is tough to get around unless you're familiar with the place though since it is associated with a number of other places too and can be confusing/ get lost if you aren't sure where you are etc.",

When we reached there at 2pm, the place was full due to covid and the next available session was at 4pm. The waiting area was filled with people to the max. There wasn't even a vending machine that you can buy drinks. The chairs also looked like it needed cleaning. When it was 4pm, it was also not our turn yet because there were still people from the 3pm list. We went in only like 4.30pm and didn't really finished the 2 hour because it closes at 6. The jacket and shoes seems dirty. The gloves were also torned. The wait for the bumper car was long. The only thing that was fun was the slide.\n\nIt understandable to limit people in the place but there should be better management such as allowing pre booking of timeslot so that people don't have to wait so long or arriving with a online ticket to find out the place was full and there is no next session. The staff outside isn't very friendly or helpful either.\n\nNot worth the time and money to go there.",

Unfortunately the day was tainted by small problems...\n\n1. We bought our tickets online that had QR code. We thought this would allow us to walk straight in, but we had to queue for 20 minutes to have this converted to a piece of paper. They then didn\u2019t have a scanner to scan my phone for this, instead I had to hand my phone to the cashier where she manually typed out the code. They will be handling hundreds of phones which is not good at all with the current covid situation.\n\n2. We then had to queue for 30 minutes to get to the lockers. This is fine, but the locker room is absolutely huge and they allowed very limited capacity. This is ok, they\u2019re trying to be responsible, but meanwhile there was little to no social distancing in the queue and the majority of people weren\u2019t wearing masks due to previously being on water slides.\n\n3. The park was very busy and the queues were 20-30 minute waits. They were implementing limited hours for certain slides and some were closed altogether. I don\u2019t understand the logic. It would surely make more sense to have all rides open at all times to spread all the people out and prevent so many people being gathering in the same place.\n\n4. There was an abundance of groups of >5. One group I saw was 20+, this isn\u2019t acceptable in today\u2019s phase. It\u2019s hard for staff to enforce this, maybe there should be external officers to enforce this more strictly.",

We even had to comply to timing i.e. only 1 hour of solemnization, wearing of masks, and photo taking was only restricted to immediate and extended family only.\nThere was no buffet served after the wedding solemnization.\nWe were only allowed 100 pax and the rest we arranged for a Youtube live feed of the whole ceremony from the start. Fortunately, the government relaxed the rules so my husband was allowed to walk her down the aisle.\nThis to me was the most memorable part of a church wedding ceremony.\nI'm really grateful for this really.",

Sincerely hope it would be a cathedral relevant to all walks of lives even in 10, 50 or 100 years time (unlike some parts of the world). Seems to observe more older folks, elderlies around during the weekend as compared to children and young adults. SAC is exceptionally busy with walk in crowds, tourists during Easter and Christmas celebrations.",

I asked her why and she said she need to stop me before I get caught by security. Completely absurd and I asked to talk to her manager. The manager, a male middle age man behaved in a gangster-like manner and asked me in an intimidating manner if I were Singaporean and know the rules, forcing me to delete the photos off my mobile phone.

The area was a lively business hub, so the mosque largely catered to South Indian merchants. One of its trustees,\nAbdul Gafoor, a Muslim Tamil chief clerk at a law firm back then, had built shophouses around it and collected enough income to construct a new mosque. He passed away in 1919 as the sole trustee of the mosque and its\nrelated properties. Today, Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS)\u2014also known as the Islamic Religious Council of\nSingapore\u2014owns the mosque. Visitors may notice its unconventional symmetry and the inclusion of classic Western designs alongside Moorish details, which set it apart from other mosques. Besides being gazetted as a national monument in July 1979, it was also awarded the\nArchitectural Heritage Award from Singapore\u2019s Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) in October 2003 to recognise its efforts in innovative restoration and conservation works.</p>",

            "text": "The prayer hall is raised above the ground and surrounded with verandahs at the entrance and sides. It is oriented towards Mecca and thus skewed away from the lot lines and the street.\nThe verandahs are enclosed by a balustrade with circular and lancet-shaped openings and framed by repetitive cinquefoil arches double-framed with heavy mouldings. The bays are marked out with pilasters with ornate capitals. The wide openings give the interior an airiness that contrasts with the heavy columns in the centre of the prayer hall.\nOn either side of the main entrance are two graduated cinquefoil arched openings. The larger ones are nearest the entrance, while the smaller ones are further away.\nThe main entrance to the prayer hall is pedimented with an elaborate sundial in which the 25 rays of the sunburst are done in calligraphy. The sundial is flanked on either side by a series of pilasters and columns in miniature. The pediment above the sundial is shaped like an onion dome. The two square minarets on the left and right are complete with miniature columns and arches.\nThere are panels with calligraphic inscriptions in several places in the mosque, including over the entrance.\nThe interior of the cupola at the centre of the prayer hall is supported by four large cluster columns that form semicircular arches. Square and round calligraphic inscriptions decorate the interior of the cupola.\nThe cluster columns that hold up the cupola have elaborate mouldings and capitals.\nFrom the exterior, the cupola emerges from the roof deck as a hexagonal-shaped tower that is divided into three levels and marked out with Doric pilasters.\nOn the first level of the tower are eight cinquefoil windows with coloured glass panes that let light through to the interior. These windows are ornamented with recessed mihrab-shaped moulding and cinquefoil arches.\nThe second level has pilasters and capitals and is topped by a balustrade with bottleneck balusters.\nThere are minarets at the corners of the hexagon. These minarets are crowned with onion-shaped domes with a crescent moon and a star at the pinnacle. The very centre of the hexagon is crowned with a large onion dome topped with a smaller onion dome. On the pinnacle is a star and crescent moon.\nThe corners of the front verandah have simpler and less elaborate cupolas.\nThe four corners of the building are anchored by large Corinthian columns in a cluster with elaborate capitals in a leaf design. The interior and exterior of the mosque have several types of columns and pilasters. They are both structural and ornamental and range from Doric to Corinthian. Columns can be paired with pilasters and pilasters are inset into columns.\nThe mihrab is plain. There is a narrow rectangular panel with a quotation from the Qur'an above it. Next to the mihrab is the minbar, a three-step timber staircase from which the imam leads prayers.\nAbove the prayer hall is a flat roof deck surrounded by a parapet wall with bottle-shaped balusters. It is topped with a line of 22 small six-level minarets crowned with onion domes, each with a crescent moon. The miniature minarets rise from the pilasters that frame the cinquefoil arched openings below\nThere is also a type of single-leafed window that is recessed and framed by an elaborate cinquefoil arch. It is flanked with pilasters and pedimented and has the same star-and-crescent pattern of the larger arched openings.\nThe ablution area in this mosque was originally a pool. This was later drained and a modern wash area put in. It is located outside at the southwest end of the mosque.",

While there is apparently system error where the blame should be on the dev team, the staffs pointed the arrow at my parent. With complete false confidence, they said their system will not have any mistake, and accused my mom for lying, saying she definitely has been there at 3pm. The staff also repeatedly asked my 8 years old sister if she has been to the attraction, giving absolutely 0 respect and trust in my mom's words. My mom is a kind woman and my sister is still small so they really couldn't talk back, had a really tough time handling the rain of accusations from the attraction staffs.\n\nWhat is there to scam for? An entry? System failure is to blame the consumer? Is that the way Canopy Park and holder group operate? Where are the core values?\n\nI urge you to not go to Sky Net if you want to avoid awful experience. Everywhere was fine but just don't go to Sky Net.",

No major recollection except being on the tram and a deer chased our tram at one part.\n\nManaged to spent a little bit more time here this time round and walked through 1 or 2 of the trails, I must say the trails are more interesting than the tram rides. If you can afford more time to walk, definitely take the trails as there are more interesting things to see.
