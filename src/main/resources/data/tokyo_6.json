May Tokyo DisneySea inspire the hearts and minds of all of us who share the water planet, Earth.\" \u2014 Michael Eisner, 4 September 2001 Tokyo Disney Resort consists of two theme parks. Tokyo Disneyland (\u6771\u4eac\u30c7\u30a3\u30ba\u30cb\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9), a \"Magic Kingdom\" park just like all the others, was the first Disney theme park to be built on non-U.S. territory. The park opened in April 1983 (but had been finished for a few months and the company waited for better weather) and was an instant success. Tokyo Disneyland's sister park Tokyo DisneySea (\u6771\u4eac\u30c7\u30a3\u30ba\u30cb\u30fc\u30b7\u30fc), which opened in September 2001, is an ocean-themed park exclusive to Japan. With 17.3 million visits in 2014, Tokyo Disneyland is the second most visited theme park in the world behind Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom; DisneySea follows in fourth place with 14.1 million visits. Tokyo Disney Resort also includes the Ikspiari (\u30a4\u30af\u30b9\u30d4\u30a2\u30ea) shopping and entertainment complex. Tokyo Disney Resort is something different from all the other Disney parks. People are more friendly, but you notice all the time that you are in the largest city on Earth when you are wandering, amazed at the fantastic shows and rides in both parks, as it is very crowded and you can expect huge queues even for the smallest attraction on a normal day. This is no Walt Disney World; in other words, it is small and can be easily tackled in about two or three days, maybe more.

It was built in 1965 after a proposition by Yasukuni's main priest, Fujimaro Tsukuba and has an annual festival held on July 13. In 1975, a steel fence was erected around the shrine and it was closed off to the public. This came after an incident on Hokkaid\u014d a year earlier where a shrine was set on fire and after the chief priest at Yasukuni had received intelligence that unknown persons were planning to destroy the Chinreisha. It was re-opened for worshipers on October 12, 2006 to spread the spirit of cherishing allies and enemies alike and remembering all the war dead around the world.\nThe shrine consists of two za, or seats for kami (spirits). One is devoted to all of the Japanese war-dead since 1853 that are not enshrined in Yasukuni Shrine's honden (main shrine).

According to the Times Higher Education, Sophia has the 20th place in its 2020 Japan University Rankings and is the top 4th private university in the country . Founded by the Roman Catholic religious order of the Society of Jesus in 1913, the University has grown from its 3 original academic departments of Philosophy, German Literature, and Commerce to 9 undergraduate Faculties and 10 Graduate Schools, with over 13,900 students in total.\nEver since Sophia was established, the University has been a leader in the internationalisation of Japanese universities. It had been conducting classes both in English and Japanese, and welcoming students from abroad from China, Korea, and even from Europe. Soon afterward, Sophia gained national repute as the leading institution in globalisation, foreign languages, and literature in Japan. As a prominent institution for research and higher learning in the fields of the social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences, the University has been selected by the Japanese Ministry of Education to be one of 37 universities to receive funding for its internationalisation efforts through the \"Top Global University Project\" .\nToday, Sophia has international students from 77 countries. It also has forged agreements with 298 overseas universities in 59 countries. It also possesses student exchange programs with several other top universities throughout the world, including Georgetown University, Yale University, The University of Georgia, Sogang University, Hong Kong University, and the University of Cologne. Before 1957, the university only admitted male students to degree programs, but the numbers of male and female students are now more or less equal. Sophia\u2019s alumni are referred to as \"Sophians\"; they include the 79th Prime Minister of Japan, Morihiro Hosokawa, several politicians represented in the National Diet of Japan, and professors at various institutions.", "properties": [{"key": "website", "name": "Website", "value": "http://www.sophia.ac.jp/", "ordinal": 1}, {"key": "subway", "name": "Subway", "value": "M, N (Yotsuya)", "ordinal": 2}, {"key": "train", "name": "Train", "value": "Yotsuya", "ordinal": 3}], "best_for": [], "tag_labels": ["district", "sightseeing", "district-kioi", "poitype-University", "district-tokyo2fchiyoda"], "tags": [{"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Districts", "short_name": "Districts", "label": "district", "location_id": "Chiyoda2C_Tokyo", "score": 8.66257063531301, "poi_count": 1170, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 6.73846759423747}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "Tokyo", "score": 9.80254684505699, "poi_count": 7646, "tour_count": 20, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "Tokyo has a vast array of sights, but the first items on the agenda of most visitors are the temples of Asakusa, the gardens of the Imperial Palace (in Chiyoda) and the Meiji Shrine (\u660e\u6cbb\u795e\u5bae Meiji-jing\u016b, in Harajuku)."}, "object_score": 6.73846759423747}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "wv__Kanto", "score": 9.80939141073584, "poi_count": 33506, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 6.73846759423747}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Districts", "short_name": "Districts", "label": "district", "location_id": "Tokyo", "score": 9.82224253308362, "poi_count": 50793, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 6.73846759423747}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "University", "short_name": "university", "label": "poitype-University", "location_id": "Chiyoda2C_Tokyo", "score": 5.24438757862375, "poi_count": 17, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 6.73846759423747}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "University", "short_name": "university", "label": "poitype-University", "location_id": "wv__Kanto", "score": 6.78418184748312, "poi_count": 352, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": null}, "object_score": 6.73846759423747}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Sightseeing", "short_name": "Sightseeing", "label": "sightseeing", "location_id": "Chiyoda2C_Tokyo", "score": 8.79380343101757, "poi_count": 397, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "Imperial Palace, +81 3-3213-1111."}, "object_score": 6.73846759423747}, {"tag": {"name_language_info": null, "name": "Kioi", "short_name": "Kioi", "label": "district-kioi", "location_id": "Chiyoda2C_Tokyo", "score": 6.64734025058134, "poi_count": 28, "tour_count": 0, "article_count": 0, "snippet_language_info": null, "snippet": "Kioi is a district located in Chiyoda, Tokyo.
